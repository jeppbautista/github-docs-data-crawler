# GitHub Docs Data Processing
**Experimental Use Only — Not For Production Use!**

This project provides a **proof-of-concept pipeline** for extracting, transforming, and loading GitHub documentation data (e.g., markdown files, site data). It is intended for experimentation, learning, and prototyping—not for production use.

Obviously this documentation sucks as well as my code because this is a rushed implementation. Let me know if you want to use this code so that I will fix this.
