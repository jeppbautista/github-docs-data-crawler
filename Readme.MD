# GitHub Docs Data Processing
**Experimental Use Only — Not For Production Use!**

This project provides a **proof-of-concept pipeline** for web crawling, transforming, and loading GitHub documentation data : https://docs.github.com/en/get-started. It is intended for experimentation, learning, and prototyping—not for production use.

Obviously this documentation sucks as well as my code because this is a rushed implementation. Let me know if you want to use this code so that I will fix this.
