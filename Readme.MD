# GitHub Docs Data Processing
ðŸš§ **Experimental Use Only â€” Not For Production Use!**

This project provides a **proof-of-concept pipeline** for extracting, transforming, and loading GitHub documentation data (e.g., markdown files, site data). It is intended for experimentation, learning, and prototypingâ€”not for production use.

Obviously this documentation sucks as well as my code because this isi a rushed implementation. Let me know if you want me to fix this.
