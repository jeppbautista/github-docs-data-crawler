# Filtering issues and pull requests by milestone
Issues and pull requests can be filtered based on the milestone they're associated with. Once you've [associated an issue or pull request with a milestone](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/associating-milestones-with-issues-and-pull-requests), you can find items based on their milestones. Within a milestone, you can prioritize issues and pull requests.
  * If you'd rather filter issues and pull requests using the Search bar, you can use the milestone search syntax. For a milestone called My Milestone, the search syntax would be: `milestone:"My Milestone"`.
  * To clear your filter selection, click **Clear current search query, filters, and sorts**.
  * You can also filter issues or pull requests using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see [`gh issue list`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_list) or [`gh pr list`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_list) in the GitHub CLI documentation.
