## [Introduction](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#introduction)
This guide demonstrates how to use Projects to plan and track work. In this guide, you will create a new project and add a custom field to track priorities for your tasks. You'll learn how to create saved views that help you communicate priorities and progress with your collaborators. You'll also set up built-in workflows to manage the items in your project.
## [Prerequisites](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#prerequisites)
You can either create an organization project or a user project. To create an organization project, you need a GitHub organization. For more information about creating an organization, see [Creating a new organization from scratch](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
In this guide, you will add existing issues from repositories owned by your organization (for organization projects) or by you (for user projects) to your new project. For more information about creating issues, see [Creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
## [Creating a project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#creating-a-project)

## [Grouping issues by priority](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#grouping-issues-by-priority)
Next, group all of the items in your project by priority to make it easier to focus on the high priority items.
  1. Click 
![Screenshot showing the tabs at the top of a project. The view menu icon is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-4878/images/help/projects-v2/view-menu-icon.png)
  2. Click 
  3. Click **Priority**.


Now, move issues between groups to change their priority.
  1. Choose an issue.
  2. Drag and drop the issue into a different priority group. When you do this, the priority of the issue will change to be the priority of its new group.


## [Saving the priority view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#saving-the-priority-view)
When you grouped your issues by priority in the previous step, your project displayed an indicator to show that the view was modified. Save these changes so that your collaborators will also see the tasks grouped by priority.
  1. Click 
![Screenshot showing the tabs at the top of a project. The view menu icon is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-4878/images/help/projects-v2/view-menu-icon.png)
  2. Click **Save changes**.


You can share the URL with your team to keep everyone aligned on the project priorities.
When a view is saved, anyone who opens the project will see the saved view. Here, you grouped by priority, but you can also add other modifiers such as sort, filter, or layout. Next, you will create a new view with the layout modified.
## [Adding a board layout](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#adding-a-board-layout)
To view the progress of your project's issues, you can switch to board layout.
The board layout is based on the status field, so specify a status for each issue in your project.
Then, create a new view.
  1. To the right of your existing views, click **New view**
![Screenshot showing the view tabs at the top of a project. The "New view" button is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-5717/images/help/projects-v2/new-view.png)
