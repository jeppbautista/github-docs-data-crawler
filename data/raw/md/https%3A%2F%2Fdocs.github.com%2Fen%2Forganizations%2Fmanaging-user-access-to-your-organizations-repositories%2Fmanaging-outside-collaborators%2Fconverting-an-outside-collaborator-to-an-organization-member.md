# Converting an outside collaborator to an organization member
If you would like to give an outside collaborator on your organization's repositories broader permissions within your organization, you can invite them to become a member of the organization.
## Who can use this feature?
Organization owners can invite users to join an organization.
If your organization is on a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can invite a new member to join the organization or reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see [About per-user pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/about-per-user-pricing). Pending invitations will expire after 7 days, restoring any unclaimed licenses.
If your organization [requires members to use two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization), users you invite must [enable two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) before they can accept the invitation.

  7. If the person you're inviting has never been a member of the organization or if you cleared their privileges, choose a role for the user and optionally add them to some teams, then click **Send invitation**.
  8. The invited person will receive an email inviting them to the organization. They will need to accept the invitation before becoming a member of the organization. You can [edit or cancel an invitation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/canceling-or-editing-an-invitation-to-join-your-organization) any time before the user accepts.
