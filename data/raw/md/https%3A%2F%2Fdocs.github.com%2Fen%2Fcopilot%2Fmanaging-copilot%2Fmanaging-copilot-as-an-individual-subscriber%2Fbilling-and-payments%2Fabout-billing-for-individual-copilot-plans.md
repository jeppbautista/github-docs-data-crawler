## [Pricing for Copilot Pro and Copilot Pro+](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/billing-and-payments/about-billing-for-individual-copilot-plans#pricing-for-copilot-pro-and-copilot-pro)
GitHub offers two paid plans for individuals: Copilot Pro and Copilot Pro+. Both plans are available on a monthly or yearly billing cycle.
**Copilot Pro**
  * **If you choose a monthly billing cycle** , you will be billed $10 USD per calendar month.
  * **If you choose a yearly billing cycle** , you will be billed $100 USD per year.


**Copilot Pro+**
  * **If you choose a monthly billing cycle** , you will be billed $39 USD per calendar month.
  * **If you choose a yearly billing cycle** , you will be billed $390 USD per year.


You can change to a monthly or yearly billing cycle at any time. The change will take effect from the start of your next billing cycle.
Note that GitHub may apply a temporary authorization hold for the value of the usage-based costs in advance, which will appear as a pending charge in your account's payment method.
### [About the 30-day trial for Copilot Pro](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/billing-and-payments/about-billing-for-individual-copilot-plans#about-the-30-day-trial-for-copilot-pro)
Copilot Pro+ does not include a trial. You will be billed immediately upon subscribing.
Before starting a paid plan for a personal account, you can set up a one-time 30-day trial to evaluate Copilot. To begin a trial, you will need to choose a monthly or yearly billing cycle, and provide a payment method. If you do not cancel the trial before the end of the 30 days, the trial will automatically convert to a paid plan.
You can cancel your Copilot trial at any time during the 30 days and you won't be charged. If you cancel before the end of the trial, you will continue to have access to Copilot until the 30-day trial period ends. See [Viewing and changing your Copilot plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/canceling-your-copilot-trial-as-an-individual-user).
If you were part of the free GitHub Copilot technical preview that was run between July 2021 and June 2022, you are not eligible for a 30-day trial.
## [About premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/billing-and-payments/about-billing-for-individual-copilot-plans#about-premium-requests)
Billing and budget setting for premium requests will start on **June 4, 2025** for all plans.
Certain requests may experience rate limits.
  * Rate limits restrict the number of requests that can be made within a specific time period.
  * High demand may result in rate limiting.


Your Copilot plan includes premium requests. Premium requests use more advanced models or features and count against your monthly premium request allowance.
To learn more about premium requests and how they affect your billing, see [About premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).
### [Purchasing additional premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/billing-and-payments/about-billing-for-individual-copilot-plans#purchasing-additional-premium-requests)
If you use all of your premium requests, you can continue using Copilot with the base model for the rest of the month at no additional cost.
If you need more premium requests, you have two options:
  * Upgrade to a higher plan with a larger monthly premium request allowance.
  * Set a spending limit for premium requests over your plan's allowance. Additional premium requests beyond the limit of your Copilot plan are billed at $0.04 USD per premium request. See [Preventing overspending](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-your-billing/preventing-overspending).


The option to purchase additional premium requests is not available to users who subscribe, or have subscribed, to Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ through GitHub Mobile on iOS or Android.
## [About changes to your Copilot plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/billing-and-payments/about-billing-for-individual-copilot-plans#about-changes-to-your-copilot-plan)
If you have an active Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ plan, and are then assigned a seat as part of a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, your personal Copilot plan will be automatically canceled. You will receive a prorated refund for any remaining portion of your personal plan's current billing cycle. You will then be able to continue using Copilot according to the policies set by your company.
You can cancel your Copilot plan at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. See [Viewing and changing your Copilot plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-your-copilot-subscription/canceling-copilot-as-an-individual-user).
## [Determining your billing date](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/billing-and-payments/about-billing-for-individual-copilot-plans#determining-your-billing-date)
Your billing date will depend on whether or not you are already being billed by GitHub.
  * **If you are not already being billed by GitHub** , in most cases your billing cycle will start on the day you sign up for Copilot. For example, if you sign up on 3 September, with monthly billing, your initial billing cycle will run from 3 September until and including 2 October, and then on the same days of subsequent months. For annual billing, if you sign up on 3 September, your initial cycle will end on 2 September the following year.
  * **If you already have a billing cycle** , billing for Copilot will be included in your next bill, or your first bill after the end of your 30-day Copilot trial. You will be charged on a pro rata basis for that initial period. If you do not already have an established billing date, you will be billed for Copilot Pro at the end of your 30-day trial, or when you set up a new paid Copilot plan.
