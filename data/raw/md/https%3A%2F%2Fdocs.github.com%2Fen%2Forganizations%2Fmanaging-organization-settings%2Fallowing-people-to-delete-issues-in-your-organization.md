# Allowing people to delete issues in your organization
Organization owners can allow certain people to delete issues in repositories owned by your organization.
By default, issues cannot be deleted in an organization's repositories. An organization owner must enable this feature for all of the organization's repositories first.
Once enabled, organization owners and people with admin access in an organization-owned repository can delete issues. People with admin access in a repository include organization members and outside collaborators who were given admin access. For more information, see [Repository roles for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization) and [Deleting an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/deleting-an-issue).
  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Next to the organization, click **Settings**.
  3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click 
  4. Under "Issue deletion", select **Allow members to delete issues for this organization**.
