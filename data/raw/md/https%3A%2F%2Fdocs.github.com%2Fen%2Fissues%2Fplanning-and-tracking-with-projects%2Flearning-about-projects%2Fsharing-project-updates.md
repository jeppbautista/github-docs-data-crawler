# Sharing project updates
You can post updates to your projects that share the current status, start date, and target date of the project itself.
## Who can use this feature?
Anyone with write access for a project can add a status update. Anyone with read access for a project can view status updates and subscribe.

## [About status updates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/sharing-project-updates#about-status-updates)
You can keep your team up to date and share high-level overviews, which people can use to determine the status of your project. You can set a status, such as "On track" or "At risk", to allow people to quickly determine the current state of the project. You can also set start dates and target dates. Your status update can also contain a message that supports formatting with Markdown.
Status updates can be found on your project's side panel, below the description and README. You can read the most recent update at the top and the full history of updates beneath. Once you've added a status update, the current status is also shown in the project's header and in lists when you're browsing projects.
## [Adding new status updates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/sharing-project-updates#adding-new-status-updates)
You can add status updates to any project you have write access for. You can't add status updates to a project that is set as a template. When you start creating a new status update, the form will default to the previous update's status, start date, and target date.
  1. Navigate to your project.
  2. In the top-right, click 
  3. Next to "Status updates", click **Add update**.
  4. To change the status, click **Status** , and then select the status that best reflects the state of the project.
  5. To change the dates shown in your status update, click either **Start date** or **Target date** , and select a new date.
  6. Optionally, in the comment field, type a message to include in your status update. You can use Markdown to format your message.
  7. Click **Save update**.
