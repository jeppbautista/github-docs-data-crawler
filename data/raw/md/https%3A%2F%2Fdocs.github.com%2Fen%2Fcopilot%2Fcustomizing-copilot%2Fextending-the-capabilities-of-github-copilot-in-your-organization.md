## [About GitHub Copilot Extensions for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-the-capabilities-of-github-copilot-in-your-organization#about-github-copilot-extensions-for-your-organization)
Copilot Extensions are a type of GitHub App that you can install on your GitHub account, to add additional capabilities to Copilot.
Any organization owner can install Copilot Extensions for their organization, but your organization must have an active Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan.
Anyone can install a Copilot Extension on their personal account. However, if they get access to Copilot through a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, they will only be able to use the extension if it is installed at the organization level.
You can also create your own custom Copilot Extensions for your organization. For more information, see [About building Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions).
## [Prerequisites](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-the-capabilities-of-github-copilot-in-your-organization#prerequisites)
Before you install any Copilot Extensions in your organization, you should set a usage policy for Copilot Extensions at the organization level. See [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/github-copilot-extensions/managing-github-copilot-extensions).
