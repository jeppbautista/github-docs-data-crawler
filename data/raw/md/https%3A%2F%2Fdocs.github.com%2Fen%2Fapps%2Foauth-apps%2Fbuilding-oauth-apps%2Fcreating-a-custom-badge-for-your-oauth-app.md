# Creating a custom badge for your OAuth app
You can replace the default badge on your OAuth app by uploading your own logo image and customizing the background.
By default, a new OAuth app will have an automatically generated [identicon](https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons). An identicon badge looks something like this:
![Screenshot of an identicon, which consists of white pixels in a random pattern on a circular yellow background.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-3363/images/help/apps/identicon.png)
After you create an OAuth app, you can customize the app's badge by uploading a logo and selecting a background color. A badge is a square logo image inside of a circular badge. You can choose a background color for the badge, which can be used to visually distinguish your app.
Your logo should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend an image size of at least 200px x 200px. See [Writing a listing description for your app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/writing-a-listing-description-for-your-app#guidelines-for-logos) for more guidance on customizing badges.
You can change a custom badge for a GitHub App that already has an approved Marketplace listing by navigating to <https://github.com/marketplace/manage>.
To create a custom badge:
  1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click 
  2. In the left sidebar, click 
  3. In the left sidebar, click **OAuth apps**.
  4. Select the OAuth app you want to modify.
  5. In "Application logo", drag-and-drop an image from a local folder or click **Upload new logo** to select an image from your computer.
  6. Crop your picture. When you're done, click **Set new application logo**.
  7. In "Badge background color", type the [hexadecimal color code](http://www.color-hex.com/) of the background color for your badge. **Note:** The "Badge background color" input field will be visible after an application logo has been uploaded.
  8. Click **Update application**.
