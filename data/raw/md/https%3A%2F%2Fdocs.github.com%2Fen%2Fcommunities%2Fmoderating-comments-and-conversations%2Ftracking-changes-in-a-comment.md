## [Deleting sensitive information from a comment's history](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/tracking-changes-in-a-comment#deleting-sensitive-information-from-a-comments-history)
Comment authors and anyone with write access to a repository can delete sensitive information from a comment's edit history.
When you delete sensitive information from the comment's edit history, the person who made the edit and when they made the edit is still visible in the comment history but the content of the edit is no longer available.
  1. Navigate to the comment where you would like to delete sensitive information from the edit history.
  2. At the top of the comment, click **edited** to open the edit history.
If you don't see the **edited** option, then the comment doesn't have an edit history.
  3. To view the details of a specific change, select it from the list of edits.
