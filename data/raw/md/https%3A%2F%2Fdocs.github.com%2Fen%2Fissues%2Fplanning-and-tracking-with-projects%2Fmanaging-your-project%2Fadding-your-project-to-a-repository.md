# Adding your project to a repository
You can add your project to a repository to make it accessible from that repository.
You can list relevant projects in a repository. You can only list projects that are owned by the same user or organization that owns the repository.
In order for repository members to see a project listed in a repository, they must have visibility for the project. For more information, see [Managing visibility of your projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-visibility-of-your-projects) and [Managing access to your projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects).
