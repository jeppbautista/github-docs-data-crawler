## [Troubleshooting issues caused by version incompatibility](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-issues-with-github-copilot-chat#troubleshooting-issues-caused-by-version-incompatibility)
Changes to Copilot Chat coincide with Visual Studio Code releases, due to Copilot Chat's deep UI integration. As a result, every new version of Copilot Chat is only compatible with the latest release of Visual Studio Code. This means that if you are using an older version of Visual Studio Code, you will not be able to use the latest Copilot Chat.
Only the latest Copilot Chat versions will use the latest large language model provided by the Copilot service, as even minor model upgrades require prompt changes and fixes in the extension. An older version of Copilot Chat will still use the latest version of Copilot code completion.
To use Copilot Chat, make sure you are using the [latest version of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates).

If you're using a Copilot plan for a managed user account on GHE.com, you'll need to update some settings before you sign in. See [Using GitHub Copilot with an account on GHE.com](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/using-github-copilot-with-an-account-on-ghecom).
### [Troubleshooting authentication issues in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/troubleshooting-github-copilot/troubleshooting-issues-with-github-copilot-chat#troubleshooting-authentication-issues-in-visual-studio-code)
If you are signed in to GitHub but Copilot is unavailable in Visual Studio Code, it may be due to an authentication problem. Try the following steps to resolve the issue:
  1. In the bottom left corner of the Visual Studio Code window, click the **Accounts** icon, hover over your GitHub username, and click the **Sign out** button.
  2. To reload Visual Studio Code, press `F1` to open the command palette, and select **Developer: Reload Window**.
  3. After Visual Studio Code reloads, sign back in to your GitHub account.
