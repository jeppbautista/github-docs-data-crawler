# Permission levels for repository security advisories
The actions you can take in a repository security advisory depend on whether you have admin or write permissions to the security advisory.
## In this article
  * [Permissions overview](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/permission-levels-for-repository-security-advisories#permissions-overview)

## [Permissions overview](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/permission-levels-for-repository-security-advisories#permissions-overview)
Repository owners, organization owners, security managers, and users with the **admin** role can:
  * Create a security advisory for the repository.
  * Access all security advisories for the repository.
  * Add collaborators to the security advisory.


Collaborators have **write** permissions to the security advisory.
Action | Write permissions | Admin permissions

Add collaborators to the security advisory (see [Adding a collaborator to a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/adding-a-collaborator-to-a-repository-security-advisory)) |  |   
Edit and delete any comments in the security advisory |  |   
Create a temporary private fork in the security advisory (see [Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a repository security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability)) |  |   
Add changes to a temporary private fork in the security advisory (see [Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a repository security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability)) |  |   
Create pull requests in a temporary private fork (see [Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a repository security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability)) |  |   
Merge changes in the security advisory (see [Collaborating in a temporary private fork to resolve a repository security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-repository-security-vulnerability)) |  |   
Add and edit metadata in the security advisory (see [Publishing a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory)) |  |   
Add and remove credits for a security advisory (see [Editing a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/editing-a-repository-security-advisory)) |  |   
Close the draft security advisory |  |   
Publish the security advisory (see [Publishing a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory)) |  |   
### [Permission differences for global security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/permission-levels-for-repository-security-advisories#permission-differences-for-global-security-advisories)
Unlike repository security advisories, anyone can contribute to **global security advisories** in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories). Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. See [Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database).
