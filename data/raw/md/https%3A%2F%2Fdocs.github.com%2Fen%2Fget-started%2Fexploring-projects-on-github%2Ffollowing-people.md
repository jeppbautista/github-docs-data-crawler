## [About followers](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/following-people#about-followers)
When you follow people, you'll see their public activity on your personal dashboard. If someone you follow stars a public repository, GitHub may recommend the repository to you. For more information, see [About your personal dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard#staying-updated-with-activity-from-the-community).
You can unfollow someone if you do not wish to see their public activity on GitHub.
