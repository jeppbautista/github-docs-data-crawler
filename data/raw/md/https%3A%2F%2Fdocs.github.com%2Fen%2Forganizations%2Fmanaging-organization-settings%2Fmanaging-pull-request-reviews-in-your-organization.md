## [About code review limits](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-pull-request-reviews-in-your-organization#about-code-review-limits)
By default, in public repositories, any user can submit reviews that approve or request changes to a pull request.
You can limit who is able to approve or request changes to pull requests in public repositories owned by your organization. After you enable code review limits, anyone can comment on pull requests in your public repositories, but only people with explicit access to a repository can approve a pull request or request changes.
You can also enable code review limits for individual repositories. If you enable or limits for your organization, you will override any limits for individual repositories owned by the organization.
