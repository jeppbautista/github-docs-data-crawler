Billing and budget setting for premium requests will start on **June 4, 2025** for all plans.
Certain requests may experience rate limits.
  * Rate limits restrict the number of requests that can be made within a specific time period.
  * High demand may result in rate limiting.


You can track your monthly usage of premium requests to help you get the most value from your Copilot plan.

## [Optimizing usage of premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/monitoring-your-copilot-usage-and-entitlements#optimizing-usage-of-premium-requests)
You can use the following strategies to maximize the value of your premium requests:
  * **Choose the right model for the task**. Some models are better suited to different tasks. If you're using a premium request, you can strategically choose which model you use to get the best result from Copilot. See [Choosing the right AI model for your task](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).
  * **Setting a budget**. Set a budget to track your overages and receive alerts when you reach 75%, 90%, or 100% of your budget. See [Preventing overspending](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-your-billing/preventing-overspending#managing-budgets-for-your-personal-account).
  * **Monitor your usage regularly**. Check your usage in your GitHub account settings to see how many premium requests youâ€™ve used. This helps you plan how much you can use for the rest of the month.
  * **Upgrade if needed**. If you find yourself consistently hitting your monthly allowance, consider upgrading to a plan with more premium requests included.
  * **Avoid retrying large prompts unnecessarily**. Submitting the same long or complex prompt multiple times may use more premium requests. Try rephrasing or simplifying your request when needed.
