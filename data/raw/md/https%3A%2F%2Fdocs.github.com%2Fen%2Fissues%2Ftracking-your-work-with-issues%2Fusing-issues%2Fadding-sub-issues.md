You can add sub-issues to an issue to break down larger pieces of work into tasks. Your sub-issues show their relationship to the parent issue allowing you to track your work across GitHub. Parent issues and sub-issue progress is also available in your projects, allowing you to build views, filter, and group by parent issue.
Your sub-issues can themselves contain sub-issues, allowing you to create full hierarchies of issues that visualize entire projects or pieces of work and show the relationships between your issues.
You can add up to 100 sub-issues per parent issue and create up to eight levels of nested sub-issues.
