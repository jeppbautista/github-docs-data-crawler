# Forking and cloning gists
Gists are actually Git repositories, which means that you can fork or clone any gist, even if you aren't the original author. You can also view a gist's full commit history, including diffs.

## [Forking gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/forking-and-cloning-gists#forking-gists)
Each gist indicates which forks have activity, making it easy to find interesting changes from others.
## [Cloning gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/forking-and-cloning-gists#cloning-gists)
If you want to make local changes to a gist and push them up to the web, you can clone a gist and make commits the same as you would with any Git repository. For more information, see [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
To clone a gist, select the Embed dropdown menu, then click **Clone via HTTPS** or **Clone via SSH**.

## [Viewing gist commit history](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/forking-and-cloning-gists#viewing-gist-commit-history)
To view a gist's full commit history, click the "Revisions" tab at the top of the gist.
You will see a full commit history for the gist with diffs.
