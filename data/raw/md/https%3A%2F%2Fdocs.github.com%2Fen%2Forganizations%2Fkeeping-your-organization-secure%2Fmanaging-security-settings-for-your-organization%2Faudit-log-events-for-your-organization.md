>   * This article contains the events that may appear in your organization's audit log. For the events that can appear in a user account's security log, see [Security log events](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events).
>   * Webhooks might be a good alternative to the audit log or API polling for certain use cases. Webhooks are a way for GitHub to notify your server when specific events occur for a repository, organization, or enterprise. Compared to the API or searching the audit log, webhooks can be more efficient if you just want to learn and possibly log when certain events occur on your enterprise, organization, or repository. See [Webhooks documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks).
