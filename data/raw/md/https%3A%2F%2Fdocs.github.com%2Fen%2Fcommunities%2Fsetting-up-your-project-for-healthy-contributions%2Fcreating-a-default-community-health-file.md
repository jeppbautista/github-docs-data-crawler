# Creating a default community health file
You can create default community health files, such as CONTRIBUTING and CODE_OF_CONDUCT. Default files will be used for any repository owned by the account that does not contain its own file of that type.

## [About default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#about-default-community-health-files)
Default community health files are a set of predefined files that provide guidance and templates for maintaining a healthy and collaborative open source project. These files help you automate and standardize various aspects of your project's development and community interaction, promoting transparency, good practices, and collaboration.
You can add default community health files to a public repository called `.github` and GitHub will use and display default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in the following order:
  * The `.github` folder
  * The root of the repository
  * The `docs` folder


If no corresponding file is found in the current repository, GitHub will use the default file from the `.github` repository, following the same order of precedence.
**Note:** The `.github` repository must be **public** for templates to be applied organization-wide. Private `.github` repositories are not supported.
For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a repository that does not have its own `CONTRIBUTING.md` file will see a link to the default `CONTRIBUTING.md` from the `.github` repository. However, if a repository has any files in its own `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder, such as issue templates or a `_config.yml` file, none of the contents of the default `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder will be used. This allows repository maintainers to override the default files with specific templates or content on per-repository basis.
Storing the files in `.github` repository allows making changes to the defaults just in one place. Additionally, they wonâ€™t appear in the file browser or Git history of the individual repositories, and are not included in their clones, packages, or downloads.
As a repository maintainer, you can use the community standards checklist to see if your project meets the recommended community standards to help people use and contribute to your project. For more information, see [About community profiles for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories).
## [Supported file types](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types)
You can create defaults in your organization or personal account for the following community health files:
Community health file | Description  
---|---  
_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md_ | A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file defines standards for how to engage in a community. For more information, see [Adding a code of conduct to your project](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).  
_CONTRIBUTING.md_ | A CONTRIBUTING file communicates how people should contribute to your project. For more information, see [Setting guidelines for repository contributors](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors).  
Discussion category forms | Discussion category forms customize the templates that are available for community members to use when they open new discussions in your repository. For more information, see [Creating discussion category forms](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/creating-discussion-category-forms).  
_FUNDING.yml_ | A FUNDING file displays a sponsor button in your repository to increase the visibility of funding options for your open source project. For more information, see [Displaying a sponsor button in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository).  
_GOVERNANCE.md_ | A GOVERNANCE file lets people know about how your project is governed. For example, it might discuss project roles and how decisions are made.  
Issue and pull request templates and _config.yml_ | Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. For more information, see [About issue and pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).  
  
If an issue template sets a label, that label must be created in your `.github` repository and any repositories where the template will be used.  
_SECURITY.md_ | A SECURITY file gives instructions on how to report a security vulnerability in your project and description that hyperlinks the file. For more information, see [Adding a security policy to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository).  
_SUPPORT.md_ | A SUPPORT file lets people know about ways to get help with your project. For more information, see [Adding support resources to your project](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-support-resources-to-your-project).  
You cannot create a default license file. License files must be added to individual repositories so the file will be included when a project is cloned, packaged, or downloaded.
## [Creating a repository for default files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#creating-a-repository-for-default-files)
  1. In the upper-right corner of any page, select **New repository**.

  2. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu, and select the organization or personal account you want to create default files for.

  3. In the "Repository name" field, type **.github**.
  4. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description.
  5. Make sure the repository status is set to **Public**. A repository for default files cannot be private.
  6. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.
  7. Click **Create repository**.
  8. In the repository, create one of the supported community health files. Issue templates and their configuration file must be in a folder called `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`. All other supported files may be in the root of the repository, the `.github` folder, or the `docs` folder. For more information, see [Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files).
