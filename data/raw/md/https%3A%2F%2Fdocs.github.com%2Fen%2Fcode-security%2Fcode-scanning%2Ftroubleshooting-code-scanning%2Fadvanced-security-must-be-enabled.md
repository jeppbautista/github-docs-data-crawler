```

This error is reported if you try to run code scanning in a repository where GitHub Code Security is not enabled or where use of this feature is blocked by a policy.
You will only see this error for repositories with private or internal visibility. GitHub Code Security is enabled by default for all public repositories.
If you are on a **GitHub Free** or **GitHub Pro** plan, you can only use code scanning on repositories that are publicly available. To enable code scanning for private or internal repositories, you must upgrade to GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise with GitHub Code Security and enable Code Security for the repository. For more information, see [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-products#github-team) and [About GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security).

If GitHub Code Security is available to your repository, you can enable it on the settings page.
If GitHub Code Security is blocked by a policy, you first need to request access.
