# Requesting to add or change a parent team
If you have maintainer permissions in a team, you can request to nest your team under a parent team in your organization's hierarchy.
When you request to add or change your team's parent, a request is sent to the maintainers of the parent team. When a maintainer of the new parent team approves your request, your team is nested as a child team under the parent team in your organization's hierarchy.
If you're an organization owner or you have team maintainer permissions in the child team and the parent team, you can add the parent team without requesting approval or change your team's parent from your team's settings page. For more information, see [Moving a team in your organization’s hierarchy](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/moving-a-team-in-your-organizations-hierarchy).
Child teams inherit the access permissions of the parent team. For more information on team hierarchies, see [About teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#nested-teams).
