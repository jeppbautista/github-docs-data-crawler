A project can contain a maximum of 50,000 items across both active views and archive page.
## [Archiving items](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/archiving-items-from-your-project#archiving-items)
You can archive an item to keep the context about the item in the project but remove it from the project views. You can also configure your project's built-in workflows to automatically archive items that meet certain criteria. For more information, see [Archiving items automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/archiving-items-automatically).
  1. If you're using a table or board layout, first select the item:
     * In a table layout, click on the row number.
     * In a board layout, click on the card.
To select multiple items, do one of the following:
     * Hold `Command` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) and select each item.
     * Select an item then press `Shift`+`↑` or `Shift`+`↓` to select additional items above or below the selected item.
     * Select an item then press `Shift` and select another item to select all items between the two items.
     * With a row or item already selected, press `Command`+`A` (Mac) or `Ctrl`+`A` (Windows/Linux) to select all items in a column in a board layout or all items in a table layout.
