## [About badges](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/creating-a-custom-badge-for-your-github-app#about-badges)
Every GitHub App has a badge. A badge is a square image inside a circular background.
By default, a new GitHub App will use an automatically generated identicon as a badge. An identicon badge looks something like this:
![Screenshot of an identicon, which consists of white pixels in a random pattern on a circular yellow background.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-3363/images/help/apps/identicon.png)
After you register a GitHub App, you can customize your app's badge by uploading a logo and selecting a background color. Your logo should be a PNG, JPG, or GIF file under 1 MB in size. For the best quality rendering, we recommend an image dimension of 200 pixels by 200 pixels.

You can change a custom badge for a GitHub App that already has an approved Marketplace listing by navigating to <https://github.com/marketplace/manage>.
