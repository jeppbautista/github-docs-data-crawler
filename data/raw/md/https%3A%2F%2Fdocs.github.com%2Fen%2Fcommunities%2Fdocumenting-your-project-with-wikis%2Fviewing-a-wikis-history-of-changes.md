# Viewing a wiki's history of changes
Because wikis are Git repositories, every change you make is a commit that you can view.
## Who can use this feature?
Wikis are available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).
