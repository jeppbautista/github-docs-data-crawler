## [About transferring GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app#about-transferring-github-apps)
The owner of a GitHub App registration can transfer ownership of the GitHub App registration to another account. If an organization has designated any app managers for an app owned by the organization, the app managers can also transfer ownership of the GitHub App registration. For more information about app managers, see [Adding and removing GitHub App managers in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/adding-and-removing-github-app-managers-in-your-organization).
You can transfer apps from a user or organization to another account. You cannot transfer ownership to a team.
