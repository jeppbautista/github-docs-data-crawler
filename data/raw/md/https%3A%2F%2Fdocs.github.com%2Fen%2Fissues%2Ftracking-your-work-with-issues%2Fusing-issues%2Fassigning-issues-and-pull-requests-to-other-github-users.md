You can assign multiple people to each issue or pull request, including: yourself, anyone who has commented on the issue or pull request, anyone with write permissions to the repository, and organization members with read permissions to the repository. For more information, see [Access permissions on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github).
You may also be able to assign Copilot to an issue, see [Using Copilot to work on an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/using-copilot-to-work-on-an-issue).
Issues and pull requests in public repositories, and in private repositories for a paid account, can have up to 10 people assigned. Private repositories on the free plan are limited to one person per issue or pull request.
