# Encouraging helpful contributions to your project with labels
Apply the `good first issue` label to issues in your repository to highlight opportunities for people to contribute to your project.
You can apply the `good first issue` label to issues in your public repository so that people can find them when searching by labels. For more information about searching by labels, see [Searching issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-label).
GitHub uses an algorithm to determine the most approachable issues in each repository and surface them in various places on GitHub. Adding the `good first issue` label can increase the likelihood that your issues are surfaced.
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  2. Under your repository name, click

  3. Select the checkbox next to the items you want to apply a label to.
