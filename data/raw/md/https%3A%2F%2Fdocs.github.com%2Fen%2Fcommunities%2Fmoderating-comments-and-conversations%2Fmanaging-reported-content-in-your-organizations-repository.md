# Managing reported content in your organization's repository
After a contributor reports disruptive content in a repository, repository maintainers can view and manage the report.
## Who can use this feature?
Anyone with admin permissions to a repository can view and manage reported content for the repository.

## [About management of reported content](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-reported-content-in-your-organizations-repository#about-management-of-reported-content)
Before you can view or manage reported content, you must enable reported content for the repository. For more information, see [Managing how contributors report abuse in your organization's repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/managing-how-contributors-report-abuse-in-your-organizations-repository).
You can track, triage, and respond to reports of disruptive content. In the "Abuse reports" list, you can view all reports and navigate directly to each reported comment on GitHub.
When disruptive behavior occurs in your community, GitHub offers tools for applying your code of conduct and de-escalating conflict. For example, you can lock a conversation to defuse a heated interaction. For more information, see [Moderating comments and conversations](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations).
After you finish moderating disruptive content, you can mark the report as resolved. If you decide that you're not done moderating, you can also mark the report as unresolved.
