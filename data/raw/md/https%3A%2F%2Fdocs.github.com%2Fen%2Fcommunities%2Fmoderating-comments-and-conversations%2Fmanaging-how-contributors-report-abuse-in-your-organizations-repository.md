# Managing how contributors report abuse in your organization's repository
You can allow contributors to report disruptive behavior directly to repository maintainers.

You can enable or disable reported content for public repositories owned by an organization.
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  2. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
