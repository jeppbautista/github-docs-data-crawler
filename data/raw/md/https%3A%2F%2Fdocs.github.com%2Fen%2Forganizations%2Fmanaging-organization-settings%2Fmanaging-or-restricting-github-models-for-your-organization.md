## [About GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-or-restricting-github-models-for-your-organization#about-github-models)
GitHub Models automates, enhances, and streamlines AI-powered software development processes within GitHub. You can use GitHub Models to manage and optimize prompts, compare models, and create robust evaluations. See [About GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/about-github-models).
## [Prerequisites](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-or-restricting-github-models-for-your-organization#prerequisites)
For GitHub Models to be available to your organization, an enterprise owner must first enable the feature for the enterprise. See [Enabling GitHub Models for an enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/github-models-at-scale/manage-models-at-scale#enabling-github-models-for-an-enterprise).
## [Enabling or restricting models in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-or-restricting-github-models-for-your-organization#enabling-or-restricting-models-in-your-organization)
You can choose to enable or disable GitHub Models for your organization. You can also choose to only allow the use of selected models or model publishers.
  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Next to the organization, click **Settings**.
  3. In the "Code, planning, and automation" section of the sidebar, click 
  4. Under "Models", in the "Models in your organization" section, click **Disabled** and select **Enabled** from the dropdown.
If GitHub Models is already enabled for the organization, the dropdown will show **Enabled** , and you can skip the step above.
  5. Under "Models permissions", select one or more options.
     * **All publishers** is the default option and indicates that models from all the current and future publishers available on the GitHub Models catalog from the GitHub Marketplace can be used in the organization.
     * **Only select models** allows you to define a list of models and publishers: 
       * Available to the organization (**Enabled list**)
       * Restricted for use in the organization (**Disabled list**)
Depending on your requirements, you can specify an enabled list, a disabled list, or both. Once you've added a publisher to a list, you can fine-tune the list by removing individual models from it.
