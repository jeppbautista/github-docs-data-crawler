# About security campaigns
You can fix security alerts at scale by creating security campaigns and collaborating with developers to burn down your security backlog.
## Who can use this feature?
Organizations on GitHub Team with [GitHub Code Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) enabled

Once you have identified security alerts in the default branches of your repositories, the next step is to identify the most urgent alerts and get them fixed. Security campaigns are a way to group alerts and share them with developers, so you can collaborate to remediate vulnerabilities in the code.

You can use security campaigns to support many of your aims as a security leader.
  * Improving the security posture of the company by leading work to remediate alerts.
  * Reinforcing security training for developers by creating a campaign of related alerts to fix collaboratively.
  * Building collaborative relationships between the security team and developers to promote shared ownership of security alerts.
  * Providing clarity to developers on the most urgent alerts to fix and monitoring alert remediation.


## [Benefits of using security campaigns](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/fixing-security-alerts-at-scale/about-security-campaigns#benefits-of-using-security-campaigns)
A security campaign has many benefits over other ways of encouraging developers to remediate security alerts. In particular,
  * Developers are notified about any security campaigns taking place in repositories they work in or subscribe to by email.
  * Developers can see the alerts you've highlighted for remediation without leaving their normal workflows.
  * Each campaign has a named point of contact for questions, reviews, and collaboration.
  * GitHub Copilot Autofix is automatically triggered to suggest a resolution for each security alert.


You can use one of the templates to select a group of closely related alerts for a campaign. This allows developers to build on the knowledge gained by resolving one alert and use it to fix several more, providing them with an incentive to fix multiple alerts.
In addition, you can use the REST API to create and interact with campaigns more efficiently and at scale. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for security campaigns](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/campaigns/campaigns).
