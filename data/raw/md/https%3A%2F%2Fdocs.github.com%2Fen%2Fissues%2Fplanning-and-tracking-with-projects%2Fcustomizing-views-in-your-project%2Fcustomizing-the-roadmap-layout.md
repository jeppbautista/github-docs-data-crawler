## [About the roadmap layout](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-roadmap-layout#about-the-roadmap-layout)
The roadmap layout provides a high-level visualization of your project across a configurable timespan, and allows you to drag items to affect their start and target dates or selected iteration. Roadmaps use your custom date and iteration fields to position your issues, pull requests, and draft issues on a timeline, allowing you to track work over time and watch progress.
You can also display vertical lines to highlight key dates for your project, including iterations, milestones, and the dates of items in your project. These markers help you get a clear overview of your upcoming workload and how it's distributed across iterations or milestones.
For more information about changing a view to use the roadmap layout, see [Changing the layout of a view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view#changing-the-project-layout).
## [Setting the start and target date fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-roadmap-layout#setting-the-start-and-target-date-fields)
You can set the date or iteration fields that your roadmap will use to position items. When you set a view to a roadmap layout, GitHub will attempt to use existing date and iteration fields you have already set up. For more information on creating new fields, see [About date fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields/about-date-fields) and [About iteration fields](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/understanding-fields/about-iteration-fields).

You can configure a view to show the sum of one of more number fields, including a count of items in the group or column. For example, if you have a number field tracking the number of hours each item may take to complete, you can display of sum of those hours for each group or column.
In a board layout, field sums are displayed at the top of each column. In table and roadmap layouts, when you enable grouping by a field, field sums are included in each group's header.
