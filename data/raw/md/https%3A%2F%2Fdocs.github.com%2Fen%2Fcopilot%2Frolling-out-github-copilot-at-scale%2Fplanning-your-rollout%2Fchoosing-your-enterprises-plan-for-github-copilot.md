When you adopt GitHub Copilot in a company, you will sign up to a Copilot plan designed for businesses. These plans allow you to:
  * Choose which users receive access to Copilot
  * Meet regulations and security requirements with features like file exclusion, policies, and audit logs
  * Benefit from advanced Copilot features


Copilot Enterprise offers additional features for enterprises that want to customize Copilot for their needs.
This article helps you to decide whether to adopt Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise.

## [About the plans](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#about-the-plans)
GitHub offers two Copilot plans for customers on GitHub Enterprise Cloud:
  * **Copilot Business** ($19 USD per user per month): includes most Copilot features in IDEs and on the GitHub website.
  * **Copilot Enterprise** ($39 USD per user per month): allows companies to customize Copilot for their code and processes, and includes a higher allowance for premium requests. To learn more, see the sections below.

## [About mixed plans](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#about-mixed-plans)
When you subscribe your enterprise account to Copilot Enterprise, you don't need to use this plan across the whole enterprise. Instead, you can choose a plan individually for each organization in your enterprise. This approach allows you to:
  * Evaluate the benefits of Copilot Enterprise for a smaller group of users before rolling it out further.
  * Enable Copilot Enterprise in the organizations where it will have the most impact, such as organizations with complex documentation or specialized engineering requirements.


## [Do we have projects with complex requirements?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#do-we-have-projects-with-complex-requirements)
For complex projects like monorepos or legacy codebases, developers in your company may need to spend a long time finding and reading documentation before they can contribute.
With Copilot Enterprise, you can create **knowledge bases** that bring together documentation from one or more repositories in an organization, allowing Copilot to synthesize information from your documentation in its responses.
## [Will we use Copilot code review at scale?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#will-we-use-copilot-code-review-at-scale)
With Copilot code review, Copilot can provide feedback on pull requests on GitHub. How much you use this feature depends on the goals of your rollout. For example, if a goal is to increase velocity by accelerating approvals of pull requests, then you may be encouraging developers to use Copilot code review as much as possible.
With Copilot Enterprise, you can make Copilot's reviews more consistent across your repositories by adding **custom coding guidelines** written in natural language. Copilot will give feedback based on the guidelines when it reviews code, which can increase developers' confidence in the reviews and allow you to encourage consistency in coding standards across teams.
The custom coding guidelines feature is only available with the Copilot Enterprise plan, and is currently limited to selected customers.
Copilot Enterprise also includes a higher allowance for premium requests, which include code reviews. To learn more, see [How much will we benefit from premium requests?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#how-much-will-we-benefit-from-premium-requests).
## [How much will we benefit from premium requests?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#how-much-will-we-benefit-from-premium-requests)
Billing and budget setting for premium requests will start on **June 4, 2025** for all plans.
Certain requests may experience rate limits.
  * Rate limits restrict the number of requests that can be made within a specific time period.
  * High demand may result in rate limiting.


Each Copilot plan includes a per-user allowance for premium requests:
  * 300 requests per user per month for Copilot Business
  * 1000 requests per user per month for Copilot Enterprise


Copilot Chat, Copilot agent mode, Copilot coding agent, Copilot code review, and Copilot Extensions use premium requests, with usage varying by model.
Copilot coding agent uses GitHub Actions in addition to premium requests. For more information, see [Managing your spending limit for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/managing-your-spending-limit-for-github-actions).
To decide if you will benefit from a higher allowance for premium requests, compare the goals of your rollout to **development tasks** that each model is specialized in. For example, the o1 model is focused on math and science. Teams who work in specialized areas may require more requests to premium models. To learn about the benefits of different models, see [Choosing the right AI model for your task](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task).
Regardless of your plan, you can set a spending limit for premium requests over your plan's allowance. Premium requests over the allowance will be charged at a rate of $0.04 USD per request, with an additional multiplier applied to certain models.
## [Making a decision](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/planning-your-rollout/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot#making-a-decision)
To summarize:
  * Choose Copilot Enterprise if your company has projects with complex requirements or large amounts of documentation. Knowledge bases give Copilot enhanced context, which can save developers time and allow them to focus on tasks they enjoy.
  * If you think your developers will benefit from premium models and Copilot code reviews, it may be cost effective to choose Copilot Enterprise rather than pay for premium requests over your allowance.
  * If you're not sure about a full rollout, choose Copilot Enterprise at the enterprise level and enable it for individual organizations where it will have the most impact.
