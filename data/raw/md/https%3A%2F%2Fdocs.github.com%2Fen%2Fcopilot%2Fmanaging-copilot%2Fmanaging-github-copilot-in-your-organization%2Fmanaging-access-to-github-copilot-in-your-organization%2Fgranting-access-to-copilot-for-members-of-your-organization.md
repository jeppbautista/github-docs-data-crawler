Billing for GitHub Copilot starts when you grant an organization member access, irrespective of when they first use Copilot. If you grant an organization member access midway through a billing cycle, the cost is prorated for the remainder of the cycle. For more information, see [About billing for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot).

You can use GitHub's REST API to grant access to GitHub Copilot for teams, or specific users, in your organization. See [Add teams to the Copilot subscription for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-teams-to-the-copilot-subscription-for-an-organization) and [Add users to the Copilot subscription for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-users-to-the-copilot-subscription-for-an-organization).
GitHub has found that many successful rollouts offer a fully self-service model where developers can claim a license without approval. To learn about options for setting up this process, see [Setting up a self-serve process for GitHub Copilot licenses](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/setting-up-a-self-serve-process-for-github-copilot-licenses).
