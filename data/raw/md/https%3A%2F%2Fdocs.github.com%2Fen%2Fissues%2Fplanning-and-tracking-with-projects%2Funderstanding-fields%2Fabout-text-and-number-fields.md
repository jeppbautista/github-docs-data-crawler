You can add custom text and number fields to your project.

You can use text fields to include notes or any other freeform text in your project.
Text fields can be used in filters, for example: `field:"exact text"`. Text fields and item titles will also be used if you filter for text without specifying a field.
Number fields can also be used in filters. You can use `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `..` range queries to filter by a number field. For example: `field:5..15` or `field:>=20`. For more information, see [Filtering projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects).
