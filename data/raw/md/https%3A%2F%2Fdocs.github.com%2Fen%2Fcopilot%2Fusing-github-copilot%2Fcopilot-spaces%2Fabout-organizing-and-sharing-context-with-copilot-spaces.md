Copilot Spaces is in public preview and subject to change.
Copilot Spaces let you organize the context that Copilot uses to answer your questions. Spaces can include code from repositories, free-text content like transcripts or notes, and more—grouped together in one place. You can ask Copilot questions grounded in that context, or share the space with your team to support collaboration and knowledge sharing.
## [Why use Copilot Spaces?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-spaces/about-organizing-and-sharing-context-with-copilot-spaces#why-use-copilot-spaces)
Whether you’re working solo or collaborating across a team, Spaces help you make Copilot more useful.
With Copilot Spaces you can:
  * Get more relevant, specific answers from Copilot.
  * Stay in flow by collecting what you need for a task in one place.
  * Reduce repeated questions by sharing knowledge with your team.
  * Support onboarding and reuse with self-service context that lives beyond chat history.


### [How are Spaces different from knowledge bases?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-spaces/about-organizing-and-sharing-context-with-copilot-spaces#how-are-spaces-different-from-knowledge-bases)
Spaces are optimized for specific tasks and grounded conversations. Because context in Spaces is scoped, Copilot's responses are more accurate and relevant.
| Copilot Spaces | Knowledge bases  
---|---|---  
Who can create | Anyone with a Copilot license | Organization owners  
Owned by | Organizations or individual users | Organizations  
Content type | Any code hosted in repositories and free-text content | Markdown files hosted in GitHub  
Context handling | Limited in size, which guarantees higher response quality given the focused selection | Unlimited, but that comes with reduced response quality  
## [Who can use Spaces?](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-spaces/about-organizing-and-sharing-context-with-copilot-spaces#who-can-use-spaces)
Anyone with a Copilot license, including Copilot Free, can create and use Spaces.
During the public preview, if you're using a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the organization or enterprise that provides your plan must have the **Opt in to preview features** setting enabled. See [Managing policies for Copilot in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#enabling-copilot-features-in-your-organization) or [Managing policies and features for Copilot in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise#copilot-in-githubcom).
Spaces can belong to a personal account or to an organization. Spaces owned by an organization can be shared with other organization members (read-only) or kept private to the person who created the space.
Questions you submit in a space count as Copilot Chat requests.
  * If you're a Copilot Free user, this usage counts toward your monthly chat limit.
  * If you use Spaces with a premium model, this usage counts toward your premium usage quota.
