# Reviewing your authorized OAuth apps
You should review your authorized applications to verify that no new applications with expansive permissions are authorized, such as those that have access to your private repositories.
  1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click 
  2. In the "Integrations" section of the sidebar, click 
  3. Click the **Authorized OAuth Apps** tab.

  4. Review the tokens that have access to your account. For those that you don't recognize or that are out-of-date, click **Revoke**. To revoke all tokens, click **Revoke all**.
