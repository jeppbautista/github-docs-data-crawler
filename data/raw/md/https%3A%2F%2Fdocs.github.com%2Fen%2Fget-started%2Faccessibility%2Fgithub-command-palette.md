The GitHub Command Palette is currently in public preview and is subject to change.
The GitHub Command Palette is deactivated by default. You can enable the GitHub Command Palette with feature preview. See [Exploring early access releases with feature preview](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/exploring-early-access-releases-with-feature-preview).
## [About the GitHub Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#about-the-github-command-palette)
You can navigate, search, and run commands on GitHub with the GitHub Command Palette. The command palette is an on-demand way to show suggestions based on your current context and resources you've used recently. You can open the command palette with a keyboard shortcut from anywhere on GitHub, which saves you time and keeps your hands on the keyboard.
### [Fast navigation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#fast-navigation)
When you open the command palette, the suggestions are optimized to give you easy access from anywhere in a repository, personal account, or organization to top-level pages like the Issues page. If the location you want isn't listed, start entering the name or number for the location to refine the suggestions.
![Screenshot of the command palette. The "Issues" and "Pull requests" pages for the current repository are suggested.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-26061/images/help/command-palette/command-palette-navigation-repo-default.png)
### [Easy access to commands](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#easy-access-to-commands)
The ability to run commands directly from your keyboard, without navigating through a series of menus, may change the way you use GitHub. For example, you can switch themes with a few keystrokes, making it easy to toggle between themes as your needs change.
![Screenshot of the command palette. "switch theme to dark" is in the command palette input, and results for changing your theme are displayed.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-27410/images/help/command-palette/command-palette-command-change-theme.png)
## [Opening the GitHub Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#opening-the-github-command-palette)
Open the command palette using one of the following default keyboard shortcuts:
  * Windows and Linux: `Ctrl`+`K` or `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`K`
  * Mac: `Command`+`K` or `Command`+`Option`+`K`


You can customize the keyboard shortcuts you use to open the command palette in the [Accessibility section](https://github.com/settings/accessibility) of your user settings. For more information, see [Customizing your GitHub Command Palette keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#customizing-your-github-command-palette-keyboard-shortcuts).
When you open the command palette, it shows your location at the top left and uses it as the scope for suggestions (for example, the `octo-org` organization).
![Screenshot of the command palette. "octo-org" is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-22946/images/help/command-palette/command-palette-launch.png)
  * If you are editing Markdown text, open the command palette with `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`K` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Option`+`K` (Mac).
  * If you are working on a project, a project-specific command palette is displayed instead. For more information, see [Changing the layout of a view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view).


### [Customizing your GitHub Command Palette keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#customizing-your-github-command-palette-keyboard-shortcuts)
The default keyboard shortcuts used to open the command palette may conflict with your default OS and browser keyboard shortcuts. You have the option to customize your keyboard shortcuts in the [Accessibility section](https://github.com/settings/accessibility) of your account settings. In the command palette settings, you can customize the keyboard shortcuts for opening the command palette in both search mode and command mode.
## [Navigating with the GitHub Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#navigating-with-the-github-command-palette)
You can use the command palette to navigate to any page that you have access to on GitHub.
  1. Use `Ctrl`+`K` (Windows/Linux) or `Command`+`K` (Mac) to open the command palette with a scope determined by your current location in the UI.
  2. Start typing the path you want to navigate to. The suggestions in the command palette change to match your text.
  3. Optionally, narrow, expand, or completely change the scope for suggestions by editing the path in the command palette's text field.
     * To narrow the scope within a user or organization account, highlight a repository then use `Tab` to add it to the scope.
     * To expand the scope, highlight and remove an item in the scope using the `Backspace` or `delete` key.
     * To clear the scope and text box, click **Clear** or use `Ctrl`+`Backspace` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Delete` (Mac).
You can also use keystrokes to narrow your search. For more information, see [Keystroke functions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#keystroke-functions).
  4. Finish entering the path, or use the arrow keys to highlight the path you want from the list of suggestions.
  5. Use `Enter` to jump to your chosen location. Alternatively, use `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Enter` (Mac) to open the location in a new browser tab.


## [Searching with the GitHub Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#searching-with-the-github-command-palette)
You can use the command palette to search for anything on GitHub.
  1. Use `Ctrl`+`K` (Windows/Linux) or `Command`+`K` (Mac) to open the command palette with a scope determined by your current location in the UI.
  2. Optionally, narrow, expand, or completely change the scope for suggestions by editing the path in the command palette's text field.
     * To narrow the scope within a user or organization account, highlight a repository then use `Tab` to add it to the scope.
     * To expand the scope, highlight and remove an item in the scope using the `Backspace` or `delete` key.
     * To clear the scope and text box, click **Clear** or use `Ctrl`+`Backspace` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Delete` (Mac).
  3. Optionally, use keystrokes to find specific types of resource:
     * `#` Search for issues, pull requests, discussions, and projects
     * `!` Search for projects
     * `@` Search for users, organizations, and repositories
     * `/` Search for files within a repository scope
  4. Begin entering your search terms. The command palette will offer you a range of suggested searches based on your search scope.
You can also use the full syntax of GitHub's integrated search within the command palette. For more information, see [Search on GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github).
  5. Use the arrow keys to highlight the search result you want and use `Enter` to jump to your chosen location. Alternatively, use `Ctrl`+`Enter` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Enter` (Mac) to open the location in a new browser tab.


## [Running commands from the GitHub Command Palette](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#running-commands-from-the-github-command-palette)
You can use the GitHub Command Palette to run commands. For example, you can create a new repository or issue, or change your theme. When you run a command, the location for its action is determined by either the underlying page or the scope shown in the command palette.
  * Pull request and issue commands always run on the underlying page.
  * Higher-level commands, for example, repository commands, run in the scope shown in the command palette.


For a full list of supported commands, see [GitHub Command Palette reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#github-command-palette-reference).
  1. The default keyboard shortcuts to open the command palette in command mode are `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`K` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Shift`+`K` (Mac). If you already have the command palette open, press `>` to switch to command mode. GitHub suggests commands based on your location.
  2. Optionally, narrow, expand, or completely change the scope for suggestions by editing the path in the command palette's text field.
     * To narrow the scope within a user or organization account, highlight a repository then use `Tab` to add it to the scope.
     * To expand the scope, highlight and remove an item in the scope using the `Backspace` or `delete` key.
     * To clear the scope and text box, click **Clear** or use `Ctrl`+`Backspace` (Windows and Linux) or `Command`+`Delete` (Mac).
  3. If the command you want is not displayed, check your scope then start entering the command name in the text box.
  4. Use the arrow keys to highlight the command you want and use `Enter` to run it.


## [Closing the command palette](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette#closing-the-command-palette)
When the command palette is active, you can use one of the following keyboard shortcuts to close the command palette:
  * Search and navigation mode: `Esc` or `Ctrl`+`K` (Windows and Linux) `Command`+`K` (Mac)
  * Command mode: `Esc` or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`K` (Windows and Linux) `Command`+`Shift`+`K` (Mac)


If you have customized the command palette keyboard shortcuts in the Accessibility settings, your customized keyboard shortcuts will be used for both opening and closing the command palette.
