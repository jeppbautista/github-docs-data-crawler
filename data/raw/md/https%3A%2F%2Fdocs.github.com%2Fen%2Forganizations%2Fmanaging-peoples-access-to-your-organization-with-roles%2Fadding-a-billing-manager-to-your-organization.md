# Adding a billing manager to your organization
A _billing manager_ is a user who manages the billing settings for your organization, such as updating payment information. This is a great option if regular members of your organization don't typically have access to billing resources.

Members of your organization's Owners team can give _billing manager_ permissions to people. Once a person accepts their invitation to become a billing manager for your organization, they can invite additional people to be billing managers.
Billing managers do not use paid licenses in your organization's subscription.
## [Permissions for billing managers](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization#permissions-for-billing-managers)
Billing managers can:
  * Upgrade or downgrade between GitHub Free and GitHub Team plans
  * Add, update, or remove payment methods
  * View payment history
  * Download receipts
  * View, invite, and remove billing managers
  * Start, modify, or cancel sponsorships


In addition, all billing managers will receive billing receipts by email on the organization's billing date.
Billing managers **are not** able to:
  * Upgrade to GitHub Enterprise or downgrade an enterprise account
  * Create or access repositories in your organizations
  * See private members of your organization

If your organization [requires members, billing managers, and outside collaborators to use two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization), the user must enable two-factor authentication before they can accept your invitation to become a billing manager for the organization.
## [Inviting a billing manager](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization#inviting-a-billing-manager)
Enterprise accounts, and organizations owned by enterprise accounts, created after June 2, 2024, have access to the new billing platform. Enterprises that participated in the public preview program also have access to the new billing platform.
If you are on the new billing platform, the process for adding a billing manager is different. See [Roles for the new billing platform](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-your-billing/roles-for-the-new-billing-platform#inviting-a-billing-manager).
The invited person will receive an invitation email asking them to become a billing manager for your organization. Once the invited person clicks the accept link in their invitation email, they will automatically be added to the organization as a billing manager. If they don't already have a GitHub account, they will be directed to sign up for one, and they will be automatically added to the organization as a billing manager after they create an account.
