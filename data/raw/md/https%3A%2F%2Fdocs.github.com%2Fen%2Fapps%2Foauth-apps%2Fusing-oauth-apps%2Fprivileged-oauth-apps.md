# Privileged OAuth apps
Some OAuth apps are privileged apps, owned by GitHub, that are granted special capabilities.
Some OAuth apps are privileged apps. These apps are owned by GitHub and are granted special capabilities. For example, even if an organization owner has restricted access by OAuth apps to the organization's data, users can still authorize these apps and use them to access data from the organization.
Some of these privileged apps are automatically included with GitHub and do not require user authorization. These apps will not appear in your list of authorized OAuth apps.
These privileged apps will appear in the user security log, but will not appear in organization audit logs. For more information, see [Reviewing your security log](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log) and [Reviewing the audit log for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization).
