# Reviewing GitHub Apps installed in your organization
You can review the permissions and change the repository access for GitHub Apps installed on your organization. You can also temporarily or permanently prevent a GitHub App from accessing resources owned by your organization.
Organization owners can review the GitHub Apps that are installed on their organization. They can view the permissions granted to the app and change the repositories that the GitHub App can access. They can also suspend or delete the GitHub App to prevent the app from accessing resources owned by the organization. For more information, see [Reviewing and modifying installed GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-modifying-installed-github-apps).
Organization owners can also use the REST API to view the GitHub Apps installed on their organization, along with the permissions and repository access granted to each GitHub App. For more information, see [REST API endpoints for organizations](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/orgs#list-app-installations-for-an-organization).
