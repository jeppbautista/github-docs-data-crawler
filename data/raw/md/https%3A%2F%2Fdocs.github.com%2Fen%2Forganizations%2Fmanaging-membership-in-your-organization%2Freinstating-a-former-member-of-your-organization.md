## [About member reinstatement](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization#about-member-reinstatement)
If a user is removed from your organization in one of the following ways, the user's access privileges and settings are saved for three months.
  * You manually removed the user from your organization. For more information, see [Removing a member from your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/removing-a-member-from-your-organization).
  * The user was removed from your organization because you've required members and outside collaborators to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). For more information, see [Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization).
  * The user was removed from your organization because you enforced SAML single sign-on. For more information, see [Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/enforcing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
  * You converted an organization member to an outside collaborator. For more information, see [Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/converting-an-organization-member-to-an-outside-collaborator).


You can restore the user's privileges if you invite them back to the organization within that time frame.
If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see [About per-user pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/about-per-user-pricing).
## [Items that are restored for reinstated members](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization#items-that-are-restored-for-reinstated-members)
When you reinstate a former organization member, the following items can be restored:
  * The user's role in the organization
  * Any private forks of repositories owned by the organization
  * Membership in the organization's teams
  * Previous access and permissions for the organization's repositories
  * Stars for organization repositories
  * Issue assignments in the organization
  * Repository subscriptions (notification settings for watching, not watching, or ignoring a repository's activity)

If a user was removed from your organization because you required members and outside collaborators to enable 2FA, you can send an invitation to reinstate a user's privileges and access to the organization before they have enabled two-factor authentication, but they must enable 2FA before they can accept your invitation to rejoin the organization.
  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Click the name of your organization.
  3. Under your organization name, click

  4. Click **Invite member**.
  5. Type the username of the person you want to reinstate and click **Invite**.
  6. Select whether to restore that person's previous privileges in the organization or clear their previous privileges and set new access permissions, then click **Invite and reinstate** or **Invite and start fresh**.
  7. If you cleared the previous privileges for a former organization member, choose a role for the user, and optionally add them to some teams, then click **Send invitation**.
  8. The invited person will receive an email inviting them to the organization. They will need to accept the invitation before becoming a member of the organization. You can [edit or cancel an invitation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/canceling-or-editing-an-invitation-to-join-your-organization) any time before the user accepts.
