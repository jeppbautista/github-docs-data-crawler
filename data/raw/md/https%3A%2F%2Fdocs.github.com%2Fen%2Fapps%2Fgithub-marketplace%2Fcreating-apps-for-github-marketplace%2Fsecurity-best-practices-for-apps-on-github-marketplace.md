# Security best practices for apps on GitHub Marketplace
Guidelines for preparing a secure app to share on GitHub Marketplace.
This article applies to publishing apps in GitHub Marketplace only. For more information about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see [Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace).
Before listing an app on GitHub Marketplace, you should follow the best practices for the type of app that you are listing:
  * [Best practices for creating a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps/best-practices-for-creating-a-github-app)
  * [Best practices for creating an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/best-practices-for-creating-an-oauth-app)


Additionally, you should have the capability to notify GitHub within 24 hours of a confirmed security incident.
In addition to following security best practices, you should also follow customer experience best practices. For more information, see [Customer experience best practices for apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/github-marketplace/creating-apps-for-github-marketplace/customer-experience-best-practices-for-apps).
