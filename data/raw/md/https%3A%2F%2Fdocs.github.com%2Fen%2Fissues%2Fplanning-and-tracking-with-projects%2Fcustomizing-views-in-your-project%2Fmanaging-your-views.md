## [Creating a project view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/managing-your-views#creating-a-project-view)
Project views allow you to quickly view specific aspects of your project. Each view is displayed on a separate tab in your project.
For example, you can have:
  * A view that shows all items not yet started (filter on "Status").
  * A view that shows the workload for each team (group by a custom "Team" field).
  * A view that shows the items with the earliest target ship date (sort by a date field).


To add a new view:
  1. To the right of your existing views, click **New view**

The new view is automatically saved.
## [Duplicating a view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/managing-your-views#duplicating-a-view)

## [Saving changes to a view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/managing-your-views#saving-changes-to-a-view)
When you make changes to a view - for example, sorting, reordering, filtering, or grouping the data in a view - a dot is displayed next to the view name to indicate that there are unsaved changes.
