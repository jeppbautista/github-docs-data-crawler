## [About access permissions on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github#about-access-permissions-on-github)
To perform any actions on GitHub, such as creating a pull request in a repository or changing an organization's billing settings, a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. For example, the ability to delete an issue is a permission. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.
Roles work differently for different types of accounts. For more information about accounts, see [Types of GitHub accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts).
## [Personal accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github#personal-accounts)
A repository owned by a personal account has two permission levels: the _repository owner_ and _collaborators_. For more information, see [Permission levels for a personal account repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/permission-levels-for-a-personal-account-repository).
## [Organization accounts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github#organization-accounts)
Organization members can have _owner_ , _billing manager_ , or _member_ roles. Owners have complete administrative access to your organization, while billing managers can manage billing settings. Member is the default role for everyone else. You can manage access permissions for multiple members at a time with teams. For more information, see:
