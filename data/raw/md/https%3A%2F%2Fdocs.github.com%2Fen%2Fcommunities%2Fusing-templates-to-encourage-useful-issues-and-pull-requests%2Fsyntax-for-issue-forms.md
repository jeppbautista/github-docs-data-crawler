# Syntax for issue forms
You can define different input types, validations, default assignees, and default labels for your issue forms.

Issue forms are currently in public preview and subject to change.
## [About YAML syntax for issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#about-yaml-syntax-for-issue-forms)
You can create custom issue forms by adding a YAML form definition file to the `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder in your repository. If you're new to YAML and want to learn more, see [Learn YAML in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/). You can define different input types, validations, default assignees, and default labels for your issue forms.
When a contributor fills out an issue form, their responses for each input are converted to markdown and added to the body of an issue. Contributors can edit their issues that were created with issue forms and other people can interact with the issues like an issue created through other methods.
Issue forms are not supported for pull requests. You can create pull request templates in your repositories for collaborators to use. For more information, see [Creating a pull request template for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).
This example YAML configuration file defines an issue form using several inputs to report a bug.
YAML```

## [Top-level syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#top-level-syntax)
All issue form configuration files must begin with `name`, `description`, and `body` key-value pairs.
YAML```
name:
description:
body:

```
```
name:
description:
body:

```

You can set the following top-level keys for each issue form.
Key | Description | Required | Type  
---|---|---|---  
`name` | A name for the issue form template. Must be unique from all other templates, including Markdown templates. | Required | String  
`description` | A description for the issue form template, which appears in the template chooser interface. | Required | String  
`body` | Definition of the input types in the form. | Required | Array  
`assignees` | People who will be automatically assigned to issues created with this template. | Optional | Array or comma-delimited string  
`labels` | Labels that will automatically be added to issues created with this template. If a label does not already exist in the repository, it will not be automatically added to the issue. | Optional | Array or comma-delimited string  
`title` | A default title that will be pre-populated in the issue submission form. | Optional | String  
`type` | The issue type that will be automatically added to issues created with this template. Issue types are defined at the organization level and can be used to create a shared syntax across repos. | Optional | String  
`projects` | Projects that any issues created with this template will automatically be added to. The format of this key is `PROJECT-OWNER/PROJECT-NUMBER`. > [!NOTE] The person opening the issue must have write permissions for the specified projects. If you don't expect people using this template to have write access, consider enabling your project's auto-add workflow. For more information, see [Adding items automatically](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically). | Optional | Array or comma-delimited string  
For the available `body` input types and their syntaxes, see [Syntax for GitHub's form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema).
## [Converting a Markdown issue template to a YAML issue form template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#converting-a-markdown-issue-template-to-a-yaml-issue-form-template)
You can use both Markdown and YAML issue templates in your repository. If you want to convert a Markdown issue template to a YAML issue form template, you must create a new YAML file to define the issue form. You can manually transpose an existing Markdown issue template to a YAML issue form. For more information, see [Configuring issue templates for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms).
If you want to use the same file name for your YAML issue form, you must delete the Markdown issue template when you commit the new file to your repository.
An example of a Markdown issue template and a corresponding YAML issue form template are below.
