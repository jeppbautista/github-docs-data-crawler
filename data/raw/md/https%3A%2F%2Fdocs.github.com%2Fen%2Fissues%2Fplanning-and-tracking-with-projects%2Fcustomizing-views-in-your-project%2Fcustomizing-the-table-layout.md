## [About the table layout](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/customizing-the-table-layout#about-the-table-layout)
The table layout is a powerful and adaptable spreadsheet comprised of your issues, pull requests, and draft issues with metadata from GitHub and the custom fields you've added to your project. You can group, sort, and filter items, and show or hide fields in your table layouts to suit the needs of everyone on your team.
For more information about changing a view to use the table layout, see [Changing the layout of a view](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view#changing-the-project-layout).

For example, if you group by "Status" and then drag an item with a status of `In progress` to the `Done` group, the status of the item will switch to `Done`. Similarly, when you add a new item to a group, the new item is populated with the value of the group.
You cannot group by title, labels, reviewers, or linked pull requests.
