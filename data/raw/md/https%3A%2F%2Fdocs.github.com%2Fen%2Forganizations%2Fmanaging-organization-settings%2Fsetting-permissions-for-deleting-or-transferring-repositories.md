# Setting permissions for deleting or transferring repositories
You can allow organization members with admin permissions to a repository to delete or transfer the repository, or limit the ability to delete or transfer repositories to organization owners only.
Owners can set permissions for deleting or transferring repositories in an organization.
Limiting the ability to delete or transfer repositories helps prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For more information, see [Best practices for preventing data leaks in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/best-practices-for-preventing-data-leaks-in-your-organization).
