# Creating a team
You can create independent or nested teams to manage repository permissions and mentions for groups of people.
## Who can use this feature?
Organization owners can create teams and can control whether all organization members can also create teams. For more information, see [Setting team creation permissions in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/setting-team-creation-permissions-in-your-organization).
Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can use team synchronization to automatically add and remove organization members to teams through an identity provider. For more information, see [Synchronizing a team with an identity provider group](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
