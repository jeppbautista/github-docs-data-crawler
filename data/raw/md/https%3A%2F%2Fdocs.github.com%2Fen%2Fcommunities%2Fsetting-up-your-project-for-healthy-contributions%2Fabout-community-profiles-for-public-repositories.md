# About community profiles for public repositories

The community profile checklist checks to see if a project includes recommended community health files, such as README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, or CONTRIBUTING, in a supported location. For more information, see [Accessing a project's community profile](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/accessing-a-projects-community-profile).

As a repository maintainer, you can use the community standards checklist to see if your project meets the recommended community standards to help people use and contribute to your project. For more information, see [Building community](https://opensource.guide/building-community/) in the Open Source Guides.
If a project doesn't have one of the recommended files, you can click the associated **Add** button to draft and submit a file.
