You can add custom instructions for GitHub Copilot Chat in order to receive chat responses that are customized to your personal preferences, across your conversations on the GitHub website. For example, you can choose to always have Copilot Chat respond in a preferred language or with a particular style. Some examples of instructions you could add are:
  * `Always respond in Spanish.`
  * `Your style is a helpful colleague, minimize explanations but provide enough context to understand the code.`
  * `Always provide examples in TypeScript.`


  * It is possible for multiple types of custom instructions to apply to a conversation. Personal instructions take the highest priority, followed by repository instructions, with organization instructions prioritized last. However, all sets of relevant instructions are still combined and provided to Copilot Chat.
  * Whenever possible, you should avoid providing conflicting sets of instructions. If you are concerned about response quality, you can also choose to temporarily disable repository instructions. See [Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui#enabling-or-disabling-repository-custom-instructions).
