### [Alternative options](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task#alternative-options-8)
The following table summarizes when an alternative model may be a better choice:
Task | Description | Why another model may be better  
---|---|---  
Quick iterations | Rapid back-and-forth prompts or code tweaks. | GPT-4.1 responds faster for lightweight tasks.  
Cost-sensitive scenarios | Tasks where performance-to-cost ratio matters. | o4-mini or Gemini 2.0 Flash are more cost-effective for basic use cases. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is cheaper, simpler, and still advanced enough for similar tasks.
