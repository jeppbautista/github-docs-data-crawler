## [About copying projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/copying-an-existing-project#about-copying-projects)
You can copy an existing project and use it as a template to save time configuring your views and custom fields.
When you copy a project, the new project will contain the same views, custom fields, draft issues and associated field values, configured workflows (except any auto-add workflows), and insights. The new project will not contain the original project's items, collaborators, or team and repository links.
You can also set projects in your organization as templates, and curate a list of recommended templates to highlight, that other organization members can then use as the base for the projects they create. For more information, see [Managing project templates in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization).
