# Approving OAuth apps for your organization
When an organization member or outside collaborator requests OAuth app access to organization resources, organization owners can approve or deny the request.
When OAuth app access restrictions are enabled, organization members and outside collaborators must [request approval](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/requesting-organization-approval-for-oauth-apps) from an organization owner before they can authorize an OAuth app that has access to the organization's resources.
Organization owners can choose whether to allow outside collaborators to request access for unapproved OAuth apps and GitHub Apps. For more information, see [Limiting OAuth app and GitHub App access requests](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/limiting-oauth-app-and-github-app-access-requests).
  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Next to the organization, click **Settings**.
  3. In the "Third-party Access" section of the sidebar, click 
  4. Next to the application you'd like to approve, click **Review**.
  5. After you review the information about the requested application, click **Grant access**.
