## [About authorized GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-revoking-authorization-of-github-apps#about-authorized-github-apps)
You may authorize a GitHub App to give the app permission to access information on your GitHub account and to act on your behalf. For more information, see [Authorizing GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps).
You should periodically review the GitHub Apps that you have authorized. If you no longer use an app, consider revoking your authorization for that app.
The authorization can only be revoked by the person who authorized the GitHub App. Organization owners cannot revoke GitHub App authorizations for their organization members. However, organization owners can uninstall the GitHub App from their organization, which will prevent the app from accessing organization-owned resources. For more information, see [Reviewing and modifying installed GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-modifying-installed-github-apps).
## [Reviewing your authorized GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/reviewing-and-revoking-authorization-of-github-apps#reviewing-your-authorized-github-apps)
