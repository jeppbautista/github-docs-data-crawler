## [About GitHub Copilot in the CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli#about-github-copilot-in-the-cli)
GitHub Copilot in the CLI provides a chat-like interface in the terminal that allows you to ask questions about the command line. You can ask GitHub Copilot to provide either command suggestions or explanations of given commands.
The only supported language for GitHub Copilot in the CLI is English.
GitHub Copilot in the CLI parses your question and provides an answer using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.
### [Input processing](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli#input-processing)
The input prompt from the user is pre-processed by GitHub Copilot in the CLI and sent to a GitHub service that is connected to a large language model that then generates a response based on the context and prompt. User input can take the form of natural language prompts or questions. It may also include choosing the command type they would like to ask about from a predetermined list, i.e. generic shell command, Git (`git`), or GitHub CLI (`gh`). The system is only intended to respond to command line-related questions. For more information about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).
### [Language model analysis](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli#language-model-analysis)
The input prompt is then passed through the language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of text data. The language model analyzes the input prompt to find the command or command explanation most relevant to your query.
### [Response generation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli#response-generation)
The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the input prompt. This response will take the form of a suggested command or an explanation of the command you asked about. If you want to run a suggested command, you need to copy the command and paste it in a separate window or tab in the terminal.
### [Output formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-features/responsible-use-of-github-copilot-in-the-cli#output-formatting)
The response generated by GitHub Copilot in the CLI is formatted and presented to you. Copilot in the CLI uses syntax highlighting, indentation, and other formatting features to add clarity to the generated response.
Copilot in the CLI is intended to provide you with the most relevant answer to your question. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for.
