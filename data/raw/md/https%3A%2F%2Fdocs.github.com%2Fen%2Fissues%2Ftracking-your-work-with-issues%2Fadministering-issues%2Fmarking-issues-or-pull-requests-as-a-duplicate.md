# Marking issues or pull requests as a duplicate
Mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate to track similar issues or pull requests together and remove unnecessary burden for both maintainers and collaborators.

For a "marked as duplicate" timeline event to appear, the user who creates the duplicate reference comment must have write access to the repository where they create the comment.
## [Marking duplicates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/administering-issues/marking-issues-or-pull-requests-as-a-duplicate#marking-duplicates)
To mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate, type "Duplicate of" followed by an issue or pull request number in the body of a new comment.
You can also use the GitHub-provided saved replies, "Duplicate issue" or "Duplicate pull request." For more information, see [About saved replies](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/about-saved-replies).

## [Unmarking duplicates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/administering-issues/marking-issues-or-pull-requests-as-a-duplicate#unmarking-duplicates)
You can unmark duplicate issues and pull requests by clicking **Undo** in the timeline. This will add a new timeline event, indicating that the issue or pull request was unmarked.
