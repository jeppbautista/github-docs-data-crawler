# Moving a team in your organizationâ€™s hierarchy
Team maintainers and organization owners can nest a team under a parent team, or change or remove a nested team's parent.
Organization owners can change the parent of any team. Team maintainers can change a team's parent if they are maintainers in both the child team and the parent team. Team maintainers without maintainer permissions in the child team can request to add a parent or child team. For more information, see [Requesting to add or change a parent team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/requesting-to-add-or-change-a-parent-team) and [Requesting to add a child team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/requesting-to-add-a-child-team).
Child teams inherit the access permissions of the parent team. For more information on team hierarchies, see [About teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#nested-teams).
  * You cannot change a team's parent to a secret team. For more information, see [About teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams).
  * You cannot nest a parent team beneath one of its child teams.
