# Deleting a repository security advisory
You can delete a repository security advisory that you've published by contacting Support.
## Who can use this feature?
Repository owners, organization owners, security managers, and users with the **admin** role can contact GitHub Support to delete a published security advisory.
This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as an owner of a public repository.
Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories). Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. For more information, see [Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database).
If you publish a security advisory in error, you can delete the security advisory by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com).
