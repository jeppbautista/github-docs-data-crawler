## [Assign multiple owners](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/best-practices-for-organizations#assign-multiple-owners)
If an organization only has one owner, the organization's projects can become inaccessible if the owner is unreachable. To ensure that no one will lose access to a project, we recommend that at least two people within each organization have the owner role. For more information, see [Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization).
## [Use teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/best-practices-for-organizations#use-teams)
We recommend using teams to facilitate collaboration in your organization. For more information, see [About teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams).
We recommend keeping teams visible whenever possible and reserving secret teams for sensitive situations. For more information, see [Changing team visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/changing-team-visibility).
