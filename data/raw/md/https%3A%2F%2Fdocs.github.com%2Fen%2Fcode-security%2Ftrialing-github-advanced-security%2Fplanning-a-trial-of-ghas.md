## [About trialing GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#about-trialing-github-advanced-security)
You can trial GitHub Advanced Security independently, or working with an expert from GitHub or a partner organization. The primary audience for these articles is people who will plan and run their trial independently, typically small and medium-sized organizations.
Although GitHub Advanced Security is free of charge during trials, you will be charged for any actions minutes that you use. That is, actions minutes used by the code scanning default setup or by any other workflows you run.
### [Existing GitHub Enterprise Cloud users](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#existing-github-enterprise-cloud-users)
For more information, see [Setting up a trial of GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-advanced-security#setting-up-your-trial-of-github-advanced-security).
### [Users on other GitHub plans](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#users-on-other-github-plans)
You can trial GitHub Advanced Security as part of a trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [Setting up a trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
### [When the trial ends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#when-the-trial-ends)
If you don't already use GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise, you will need to upgrade your plan to continue using GitHub Secret Protection or GitHub Code Security in private repositories when the trial ends.
GitHub Secret Protection and GitHub Code Security are billed by usage of unique committers to repositories with Secret Protection or Code Security enabled. For more information, see [About billing for GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security).
## [Define your company goals](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#define-your-company-goals)
Before you start a trial, you should define the purpose of the trial and identify the key questions you need to answer. Maintaining a strong focus on these goals will enable you to plan a trial that maximizes discovery and ensures that you have the information needed to decide whether or not to upgrade.
If your company already uses GitHub, consider what needs are currently unmet that Secret Protection or Code Security might address. You should also consider your current application security posture and longer term aims. For inspiration, see [Design Principles for Application security](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/application-security/design-principles/) in the GitHub well-architected documentation.

Monitor and track trends in security risks | Security overview, see [Viewing security insights](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-overview/viewing-security-insights)  
If your company doesn't use GitHub yet, you are likely to have additional questions including how the platform handles data residency, secure account management, and repository migration. For more information, see [Getting started with GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-github-enterprise-cloud).
## [Identify the members of your trial team](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#identify-the-members-of-your-trial-team)
GitHub Advanced Security enables you to integrate security measures throughout the software development life cycle, so it's important to ensure that you include representatives from all areas of your development cycle. Otherwise you risk making a decision without having all the data you need. A trial includes 50 licenses which provides scope for representation from a wide range of people.
You may also find it helpful to identify a champion for each company need that you want to investigate.
## [Determine whether preliminary research is needed](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#determine-whether-preliminary-research-is-needed)
If members of your trial team have not yet used the core features of GitHub Advanced Security, it may be helpful to add an experimentation phase in public repositories before you start a trial. Many of the primary features of code scanning and secret scanning can be used on public repositories. Having a good understanding of the core features will allow you to focus your trial period on private repositories, and exploring the additional features and control available with Secret Protection and Code Security.
For more information, see [About secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning), [About code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning), and [About supply chain security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-supply-chain-security).
Organizations on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise can run a free report to scan the code in their organization for leaked secrets. This can help you understand the current exposure of the repositories in your organization to leaked secrets, as well as see how many existing secret leaks could have been prevented by Secret Protection. See [About the secret risk assessment](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/understanding-your-organizations-exposure-to-leaked-secrets/about-secret-risk-assessment).
## [Agree the organizations and repositories to test](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#agree-the-organizations-and-repositories-to-test)
Generally it is best to use an existing organization for a trial. This ensures that you can trial the features in repositories you know well and that accurately represent your coding environment. Once you start the trial, you may want to create additional organizations with test code to expand your explorations.
Be aware that deliberately insecure applications, such as WebGoat, may contain coding patterns that appear to be insecure, but which code scanning determines cannot be exploited. Code scanning typically generates fewer results for artificially insecure codebases than other static application security scanners.
## [Define the assessment criteria for the trial](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security/planning-a-trial-of-ghas#define-the-assessment-criteria-for-the-trial)
For each company need or goal that you identify, determine what criteria you will measure to determine whether it is successfully met or not. For example, if one need is to enforce the use of security features, you might define a range of test cases for security configurations and policies to give you confidence that they enforce processes as you expect.
