# About single select fields
You can create single select fields with multiple options, each with a description and a color, that can be selected from a dropdown menu.

You can filter by your single select fields by specifying the option, for example: `fieldname:option`. You can filter for multiple values by providing a comma-separated list of options, for example: `fieldname:option,option`. For more information, see [Filtering projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects).
Single select fields can contain up to 50 options.
