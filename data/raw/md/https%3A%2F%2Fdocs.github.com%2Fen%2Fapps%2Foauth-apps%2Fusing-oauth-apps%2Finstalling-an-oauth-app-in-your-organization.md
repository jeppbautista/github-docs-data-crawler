## [About installing OAuth apps in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/installing-an-oauth-app-in-your-organization#about-installing-oauth-apps-in-your-organization)
This article applies to installing and purchasing apps from GitHub Marketplace only. For more information on apps purchased from integrators, see [About using integrations](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-integrations/about-integrations).
If an app requires organization-level access, then only an organization owner can purchase, install, or cancel the app, and manage app billing for the organization. If the app doesn't require organization-level access, then a repository administrator can install and uninstall the app.
If you choose a paid plan, you'll pay for your app subscription on your organization's current billing date using your organization's existing payment method.
If you choose a paid plan with a free trial, you can cancel at any time during your trial period without being charged, but you will automatically lose access to the app. Your paid subscription will start at the end of the 14-day trial. For more information, see [About billing for GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-marketplace-apps/about-billing-for-github-marketplace).

If you belong to any organizations that enforce SAML single sign-on, you may be prompted to authenticate through your identity provider before you can authorize an OAuth app. For more information about SAML, see [About authentication with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on)" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.
