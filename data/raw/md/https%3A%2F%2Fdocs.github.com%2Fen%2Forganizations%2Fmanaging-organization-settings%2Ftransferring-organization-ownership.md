# Transferring organization ownership
To make someone else the owner of an organization account, you must add a new owner, ensure that the billing information is updated, and then remove yourself from the account.
  1. If you're the only member with _owner_ privileges, give another organization member the owner role. For more information, see [Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization#appointing-an-organization-owner).
  2. Contact the new owner and make sure they are able to [access the organization's settings](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/accessing-your-organizations-settings).
  3. If you are currently responsible for paying for GitHub in your organization, you'll also need to have the new owner or a [billing manager](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization) update the organization's payment information. For more information, see [Managing your payment and billing information](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-your-billing/managing-your-payment-and-billing-information).
Removing yourself from the organization **does not** update the billing information on file for the organization account. The new owner or a billing manager must update the billing information on file to remove your credit card or PayPal information.
  4. [Remove yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-membership-in-organizations/removing-yourself-from-an-organization) from the organization.
