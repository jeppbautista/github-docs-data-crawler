`is:private` | Returns projects are set to private visibility.  
`is:public` | Returns projects are set to public visibility.  
`creator:USERNAME` | Returns projects created by USERNAME. For example, `creator:octocat` will return projects created by @octocat.  
You can also change how the projects are ordered.
Qualifier | Explanation  
---|---  
`sort:title-asc` | Sort by project title.  
`sort:updated-asc` or `sort:updated-desc` | Sort by when the project was last updated.  
`sort:created-asc` or `sort:created-desc` | Sort by when the project was created.
