## [About labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#about-labels)
You can manage your work on GitHub by creating labels to categorize issues, pull requests, and discussions. You can apply labels in the repository the label was created in. Once a label exists, you can use the label on any issue, pull request, or discussion within that repository.
## [About default labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#about-default-labels)
GitHub provides default labels in every new repository. You can use these default labels to help create a standard workflow in a repository.
Label | Description  
---|---  
`bug` | Indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior  
`documentation` | Indicates a need for improvements or additions to documentation  
`duplicate` | Indicates similar issues, pull requests, or discussions  
`enhancement` | Indicates new feature requests  
`good first issue` | Indicates a good issue for first-time contributors  
`help wanted` | Indicates that a maintainer wants help on an issue or pull request  
`invalid` | Indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion is no longer relevant  
`question` | Indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion needs more information  
`wontfix` | Indicates that work won't continue on an issue, pull request, or discussion  
Default labels are included in every new repository when the repository is created, but you can edit or delete the labels later.
Issues with the `good first issue` label are used to populate the repository's `contribute` page. For an example of a `contribute` page, see [github/docs/contribute](https://github.com/github/docs/contribute).
Organization owners can customize the default labels for repositories in their organization. For more information, see [Managing default labels for repositories in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-default-labels-for-repositories-in-your-organization).
