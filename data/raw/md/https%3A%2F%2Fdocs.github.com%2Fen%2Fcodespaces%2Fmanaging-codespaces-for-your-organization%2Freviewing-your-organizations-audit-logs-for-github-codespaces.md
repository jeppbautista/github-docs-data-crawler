# Reviewing your organization's audit logs for GitHub Codespaces
You can use the audit log to review all actions related to GitHub Codespaces.
## Who can use this feature?
Organizations on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise plans can pay for members' and collaborators' use of GitHub Codespaces. These organizations can then access settings and policies to manage codespaces paid for by the organization. For more information, see [Choosing who owns and pays for codespaces in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/choosing-who-owns-and-pays-for-codespaces-in-your-organization#about-ownership-of-codespaces) and [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).
When any member of your organization performs an action related to GitHub Codespaces, you can review the actions in the audit log. For information about accessing the log, see [Reviewing the audit log for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization#accessing-the-audit-log).
