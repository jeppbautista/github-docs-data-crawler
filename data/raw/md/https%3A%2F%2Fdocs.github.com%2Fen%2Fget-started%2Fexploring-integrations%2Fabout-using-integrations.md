# About using integrations
Integrations are tools and services that connect with GitHub to complement and extend your workflow.
Integrations are tools that extend GitHub's functionality. Integrations can do things on GitHub like open issues, comment on pull requests, and manage projects. They can also do things outside of GitHub based on events that happen on GitHub. For example, an integration can post on Slack when an issue is opened on GitHub.
You can discover many integrations in [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace). GitHub Marketplace includes GitHub Apps, OAuth apps, and custom actions that you can use in GitHub Actions workflows. You can also get integrations directly from the integration creator.
For a list of featured GitHub integrations, see [Featured GitHub integrations](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-integrations/featured-github-integrations).
