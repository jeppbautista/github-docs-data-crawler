# Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository
Owners and administrators of public repositories can allow security researchers to report vulnerabilities securely in the repository by enabling private vulnerability reporting.
## Who can use this feature?
Repository owners, organization owners, security managers, and users with the **admin** role

## [About privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository#about-privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
Security researchers often feel responsible for alerting users to a vulnerability that could be exploited. If there are no clear instructions about contacting maintainers of the repository containing the vulnerability, security researchers may have no other choice but to post about the vulnerability on social media, send direct messages to the maintainer, or even create public issues. This situation can potentially lead to a public disclosure of the vulnerability details.
Private vulnerability reporting makes it easy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to you using a simple form.
When a security researcher reports a vulnerability privately, you are notified and can choose to either accept it, ask more questions, or reject it. If you accept the report, you're ready to collaborate on a fix for the vulnerability in private with the security researcher.
For maintainers, the benefits of using private vulnerability reporting are:
  * Less risk of being contacted publicly, or via undesired means.
  * Receive reports in the same platform you resolve them in for simplicity
  * The security researcher creates or at least initiates the advisory report on the behalf of maintainers.
  * Maintainers receive reports in the same platform as the one used to discuss and resolve the advisories.
  * Vulnerability less likely to be in the public eye.
  * The opportunity to discuss vulnerability details privately with security researchers and collaborate on the patch.


The instructions in this article refer to enablement at repository level. For information about enabling the feature at organization level, see [Configuring private vulnerability reporting for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-an-organization).
## [Enabling or disabling private vulnerability reporting for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository#enabling-or-disabling-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  2. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.

  3. In the "Security" section of the sidebar, click 
  4. Under "Advanced Security", to the right of "Private vulnerability reporting", click **Enable** or **Disable** , to enable or disable the feature, respectively.

When private vulnerability reporting is enabled for a repository, security researchers will see a new button in the **Advisories** page of the repository. The security researcher can click this button to privately report a security vulnerability to the repository maintainer.

Security researchers can also use the REST API to privately report security vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Privately report a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/security-advisories/repository-advisories#privately-report-a-security-vulnerability).
## [Configuring notifications for private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository#configuring-notifications-for-private-vulnerability-reporting)
When a new vulnerability is privately reported on a repository where private vulnerability reporting is enabled, GitHub notifies repository maintainers and security managers if:
  * They're watching the repository for all activity.
  * They have notifications enabled for the repository.


Notifications depend on the user's notification preferences. You will receive an email notification if:
  * You are watching the repository.
  * You have enabled notifications for "All Activity".
  * In your notification settings, under "Subscriptions", then under "Watching", you have selected to receive notifications by email.


  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  2. To start watching the repository, select 
![Screenshot of the repository's main page. A dropdown menu, titled "Watch", is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-6045/images/help/repository/repository-watch-dropdown.png)
  3. In the dropdown menu, click **All Activity**.
  4. Navigate to the notification settings for your personal account. These are available at <https://github.com/settings/notifications>.
  5. On your notification settings page, under "Subscriptions," then under "Watching," select the **Notify me** dropdown.
  6. Select "Email" as a notification option, then click **Save**.
![Screenshot of the notification settings for a user account. Under "Subscriptions" and "Watching" a checkbox, titled "Email", is outlined in orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-65804/images/help/notifications/repository-watching-notification-options.png)
