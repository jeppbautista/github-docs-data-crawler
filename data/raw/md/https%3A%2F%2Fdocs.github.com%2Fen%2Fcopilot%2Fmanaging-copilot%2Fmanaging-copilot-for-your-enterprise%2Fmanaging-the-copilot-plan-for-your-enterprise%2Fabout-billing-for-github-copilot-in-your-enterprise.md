## [About Copilot plans for your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-the-copilot-plan-for-your-enterprise/about-billing-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#about-copilot-plans-for-your-enterprise)
GitHub offers the following plans for enterprise accounts:
  * **Copilot Business** at $19 USD per user per month
  * **Copilot Enterprise** at $39 USD per user per month


When you subscribe to Copilot Enterprise at the enterprise level, you can choose which plan to enable for each organization in your enterprise.
For guidance, see [Choosing your enterprise's plan for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/rolling-out-github-copilot-at-scale/choosing-your-enterprises-plan-for-github-copilot).

Paid Copilot plans include premium requests. Premium requests use advanced models and features and are subject to monthly allowances or potential overage costs. See [About premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs).
## [About the billing cycle for Copilot in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-the-copilot-plan-for-your-enterprise/about-billing-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#about-the-billing-cycle-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise)
Billed users are calculated at the end of each billing cycle, based on the number of GitHub Copilot seats that are assigned. You can add or remove seats at any time during the billing cycle.
  * **Any seat assigned part way through the billing cycle** will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in the cycle.
  * **Any seat assignment removed during a billing cycle** will take effect from the beginning of the next cycle. The person will still be able to use GitHub Copilot until the end of the cycle. If a user's access to organizations in the enterprise with Copilot seats is removed, they will lose access immediately.


Your enterprise will be charged on whichever payment method youâ€™ve set up for the enterprise account, such as a credit card or a Microsoft Azure subscription.
Note that GitHub may apply a temporary authorization hold for the value of the usage-based costs in advance, which will appear as a pending charge in your account's payment method.
GitHub Copilot billing operates in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), but it calculates your bill according to the timezone of your billing cycle. For example, if you're billed through Azure and your current billing cycle ends at 11:59 PM EST on December 1st, canceling a seat at 7:00 PM EST on December 1st might show the seat cancellation at 12:00 AM UTC on December 2nd. However, the seat would end within the billing cycle that you requested the cancellation, and you would not pay for that seat in the following cycle.
### [About seat assignment for Copilot in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-the-copilot-plan-for-your-enterprise/about-billing-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#about-seat-assignment-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise)
A GitHub Copilot seat is a license to use GitHub Copilot, which is granted to a unique user account through an enterprise's GitHub Copilot Business or GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan. Each month, the enterprise is charged for the number of assigned seats.
If a single user receives a seat from multiple organizations in the same enterprise, the enterprise will only be billed once per billing cycle for that unique user. One of the organizations that assigned Copilot to the user will be chosen at random each month to be billed for the seat.
Seat assignment is managed by owners of organizations. See [Granting access to Copilot for members of your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization/granting-access-to-copilot-for-members-of-your-organization).
If you are a member of an organization or enterprise with a GitHub Copilot plan, to use the plan, you will need to be assigned a seat by an organization owner.
### [About billing through Azure](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-the-copilot-plan-for-your-enterprise/about-billing-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#about-billing-through-azure)
When you connect an Azure subscription to your organization or enterprise account and enable metered billing via Azure, metered usage will start to be sent to Azure. You will be billed through GitHub for usage from the start of the current billing cycle to when you enabled metered billing via Azure, on your next billing date. The period between the date you connected your Azure subscription and enabled metered billing via Azure, and the end of the calendar month will be charged in Azure on the first of the month. For more information, see [Connecting an Azure subscription](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription).
Usage data is sent to Azure daily, but you are billed at the end of the month based on the number of seats used. This means that although you can track your daily spending (number of seats in this case), actual payments are processed monthly.
## [About changes to your Copilot plan](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-the-copilot-plan-for-your-enterprise/about-billing-for-github-copilot-in-your-enterprise#about-changes-to-your-copilot-plan)
If you upgrade an organization from Copilot Business to Copilot Enterprise, all users who currently have a seat for Copilot Business will immediately receive access to Copilot Enterprise. You will be charged for each GitHub Copilot Enterprise seat pro rata for the rest of the cycle.
If you downgrade an organization's GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan during a billing cycle, the users will have access to GitHub Copilot Enterprise for the rest of the cycle, and the change to your bill will take effect from the following cycle.
Disabling GitHub Copilot for all organizations in your enterprise will cancel your enterprise's Copilot plan.
If you have an active Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ plan, and are then assigned a seat as part of a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, your personal Copilot plan will be automatically canceled. You will receive a prorated refund for any remaining portion of your personal plan's current billing cycle. You will then be able to continue using Copilot according to the policies set by your company.
