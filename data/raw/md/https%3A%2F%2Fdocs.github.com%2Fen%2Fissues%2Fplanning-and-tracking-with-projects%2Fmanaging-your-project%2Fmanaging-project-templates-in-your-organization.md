# Managing project templates in your organization
You can create templates or set projects as templates in your organization, allowing other people to select your template as the base for projects they create.
## Who can use this feature?
People with admin permissions for a project in an organization can set the project as a template. People with admin or write permissions for a project in an organization can copy the project and set the copied project as a template.

## [About templates](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-project-templates-in-your-organization#about-templates)
You can create a template, or set a project as a template, to share a pre-configured project with other people in your organization which they can then use as the base for their projects.
The projects you mark as templates are shown in the "Create a project" dialog when anyone creates a project in your organization. You can also configure up to six templates to recommend to your organization's members.
When someone creates a project from a template, the views, custom fields, draft issues and associated field values, configured workflows (except any auto-add workflows), and insights are copied from the template to the new project. You can find the template that a project used from the project's settings page, under the "Templates" section.
