Copilot coding agent is in public preview and subject to change.
## [Introduction](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/using-the-copilot-coding-agent-logs#introduction)
After you assign an issue to Copilot, or use Copilot Chat to ask Copilot to create a pull request, Copilot works autonomously to complete the task. See [About assigning tasks to Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/about-assigning-tasks-to-copilot).
During or after an agent session, you can inspect the session logs to understand Copilot's approach to your problem.
## [Using the session logs to understand Copilot's approach](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/using-the-copilot-coding-agent-logs#using-the-session-logs-to-understand-copilots-approach)
To view the session logs, click **View session** in the pull request timeline.

In the session logs, you can see Copilot's internal monologue and the tools it used to understand your repository, make changes and validate its work.
Copilot has its own development environment, including the ability to run automated tests and linters, to validate its changes before it pushes.
## [Stopping a Copilot session](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/using-the-copilot-coding-agent-logs#stopping-a-copilot-session)
You can stop Copilot from continuing to work on a task by clicking **Stop session** in the session log viewer.
![Screenshot of the log viewer with the 'Stop session' button highlighted.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-72575/images/help/copilot/coding-agent/log-stop-session.png)
Reasons you might want to stop a session include:
  * Copilot appears to be going in a wrong direction, and you want to stop it and give it more clarity.
  * You made a mistake in your description of the required work, and you've decided to start over.
  * You've realized that the change you asked for doesn't need to be made, so you want to stop Copilot from doing any more work on it.
