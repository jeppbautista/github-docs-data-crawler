This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as an owner of a public repository.
Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories). Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. For more information, see [Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database).

Collaborators have write permissions to the security advisory. For more information, see [Permission levels for repository security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/permission-levels-for-repository-security-advisories).
If you remove a user from a repository or organization, and the user is also a collaborator on a security advisory, GitHub will automatically remove the user as a collaborator for the security advisory. This prevents any unauthorized access from ex-collaborators. For more information about removing a collaborator on a security advisory, see [Removing a collaborator from a repository security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-repository-security-advisory).
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
