## [About export of membership information](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/exporting-member-information-for-your-organization#about-export-of-membership-information)
You can export aggregated information about your organization's members as a report. For example, you may want to perform an audit of your organization's current members. You can generate a file containing the report from GitHub's web UI.
The membership information report includes the following information.
  * Username and display name details
  * Whether the user has two-factor authentication enabled
  * Whether the membership is public or private
  * Whether the user is an organization owner or member
  * Datetime of the user's last activity (such as timeline events, session updates, or access to resources via a personal access token or SSH key)


You can also use GitHub's APIs to retrieve information about your organization's members. For more information, see the [GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#user) and [REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users) documentation.
