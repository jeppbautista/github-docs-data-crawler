## [About base permissions for projects](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-base-permissions-for-projects#about-base-permissions-for-projects)
You can set a project's base permission to control the level of access for all members of your organization. You can then specify individual and team permissions for each project in addition to the base permission. For more information on setting permissions for individual projects, see [Managing access to your projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects).
When you set the base permission for projects in your organization's settings, the base permission will apply to any new projects created by organization members and existing projects that do not currently have a base permission configured in the project's settings.
When you migrate a project (classic) to an organization, the organization's base permission for projects will not be applied. After migrating your project, make sure to confirm the project's permissions. For more information, see [Managing access to your projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects).
