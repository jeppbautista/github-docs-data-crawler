## [Discovering relevant projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github#discovering-relevant-projects)
If there's a particular topic that interests you, visit `github.com/topics/<topic>`. For example, if you are interested in machine learning, you can find relevant projects and good first issues by visiting <https://github.com/topics/machine-learning>. You can browse popular topics by visiting [Topics](https://github.com/topics). You can also search for repositories that match a topic you're interested in. See [Searching for repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-for-repositories#search-by-topic).
If you're interested in contributing to projects that **reduce the carbon emissions of software** , review [GitHub's Green Software Directory](https://github.com/github/GreenSoftwareDirectory).
If you've been active on GitHub, you can find personalized recommendations for projects and good first issues based on your past contributions, stars, and other activities in [Explore GitHub](https://github.com/explore).
Keep up with recent activity from repositories you watch, as well as people and organizations you follow, with your personal dashboard. For more information, see [About your personal dashboard](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-user-account-settings/about-your-personal-dashboard).
You can connect with developers around the world to ask and answer questions, learn, and interact directly with GitHub staff. To get the conversation started, see [GitHub Community Support](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/).
## [Finding good first issues](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github#finding-good-first-issues)
If you already know what project you want to work on, you can find beginner-friendly issues in that repository by visiting `github.com/<owner>/<repository>/contribute`. For an example, you can find ways to make your first contribution to `electron/electron` at <https://github.com/electron/electron/contribute>.
