# Unblocking a user from your organization
Organization owners and moderators can unblock a user who was previously blocked, restoring their access to the organization's repositories.

After unblocking a user from your organization, they'll be able to contribute to your organization's repositories.
If you selected a specific amount of time to block the user, they will be automatically unblocked when that period of time ends. For more information, see [Blocking a user from your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization).
Any settings that were removed when you blocked the user from your organization, such as collaborator status, stars, and watches, will not be restored when you unblock the user.
