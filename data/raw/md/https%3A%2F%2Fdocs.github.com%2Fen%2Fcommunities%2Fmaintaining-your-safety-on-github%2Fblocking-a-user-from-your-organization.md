You can block non-members from within your organization's settings or from a specific comment made by a user. When you block a user in a comment, you can choose to send the user a notification explaining that they were blocked and why. Otherwise, the user is not directly notified that you've blocked them. Blocked users can still delete their existing content.
When you block a user, you can choose to block them indefinitely or for a specific amount of time. If you block someone for a specific amount of time, they are automatically unblocked after the chosen time expires. If you block someone indefinitely, you can unblock them manually at any time. For more information, see [Unblocking a user from your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/unblocking-a-user-from-your-organization).
If you're blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see [Locking conversations](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations).
At the time that you block a user from your organization:
  * The user stops watching your organization's repositories
  * The user's stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories
  * The user's votes on discussions or comments in your organization's repositories are deleted
  * The user is removed as a collaborator on your organization's repositories
  * The user's contributions to your organization's repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them
  * Any pending repository or organization invitations to the blocked user are canceled


After you've blocked a user from your organization, they cannot:
  * Cross-reference your organization's repositories in comments
  * Fork, watch, pin, or star your organization's repositories


In your organization's repositories, blocked users also cannot:
  * Open issues
  * Send, close, or merge pull requests
  * Comment on issues, pull requests, or commits
  * Add or edit wiki pages
