## [About integration access requests](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/limiting-oauth-app-and-github-app-access-requests#about-integration-access-requests)
When integration access requests are enabled, outside collaborators can request organization access for GitHub Apps and OAuth apps which have not yet been approved by your organization. If you disable integration access requests, only organization members will be able to request organization access for unapproved GitHub Apps and OAuth apps. Outside collaborators will still be able to consent to pre-approved GitHub Apps and OAuth apps accessing the same resources the requesting outside collaborator has access to.
By default, integration access requests are enabled. If your organization has a large number of outside collaborators, you may want to disable integration access requests, to reduce the number of requests you have to review.
