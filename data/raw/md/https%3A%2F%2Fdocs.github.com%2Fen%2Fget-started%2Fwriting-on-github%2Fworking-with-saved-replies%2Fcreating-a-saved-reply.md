# Creating a saved reply
If you frequently add the same comment over and over, you can create a saved reply.
  1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click 
  2. In the "Code, planning, and automation" section of the sidebar, click 
  3. Under "Add a saved reply", add a title for your saved reply.
  4. In the "Write" field, add the content you'd like to use for the saved reply. For information on using Markdown, see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
