# Removing an outside collaborator from an organization repository
Owners and repository admins can remove an outside collaborator's access to a repository.

  * When removing an outside collaborator from a private repository, the paid license count does not automatically downgrade. To pay for fewer licenses after removing users from your organization, follow the steps in [Downgrading your account's plan](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan).
  * You are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property.


While forks of private repositories are deleted when a collaborator is removed, the person will still retain any local clones of your repository.
