# Changing team visibility
Team maintainers and organization owners can determine whether a team is _visible_ or _secret_.
Teams can be visible or secret:
  * Visible teams can be [viewed and @mentioned](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) by every organization member.
  * Secret teams are only visible to the people on the team and people with owner permissions. They're great for hiding teams with sensitive names or members, such as those used for working with external partners or clients. Secret teams cannot be nested under parent teams or have child teams.


People who are not members of the organization cannot view any teams.
If a team has [child or parent teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams), you cannot make it a secret team.
