# Creating a new organization from scratch
Create an organization to apply fine-grained access permissions to repositories.
When you create a new organization from scratch, it doesn't have any repositories associated with it. For more information on adding repositories to your organization, see [Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) and [Transferring a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository).
  1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click 
  2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click 
  3. Next to the "Organizations" header, click **New organization**.
  4. Follow the prompts to create your organization. For more information about the plans available for your team, see [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).
