# Privileged GitHub Apps
Some GitHub Apps are privileged apps, owned by GitHub, that are granted special capabilities.
Some GitHub Apps are privileged apps. These apps are owned by GitHub and are granted special capabilities. For example, users can authorize these apps and use them to access data from an organization without requiring approval by the organization.
Some of these privileged apps are automatically included with GitHub and do not require user authorization. These apps will not appear in your list of authorized GitHub Apps or in your list of installed GitHub Apps.
These privileged apps will appear in the user security log, but will not appear in organization audit logs. For more information, see [Reviewing your security log](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/reviewing-your-security-log) and [Reviewing the audit log for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization).
