# Automatic build failed for a compiled language
If automatic build fails, you can configure code scanning to use specific build steps for compiled languages.
If an automatic build of code for a compiled language within your project fails, you can try changing to the `manual` build mode or removing the `autobuild` step from your code scanning workflow and adding specific build steps. If you're not already using advanced setup, you'll need to enable it first to create a workflow you can edit.
