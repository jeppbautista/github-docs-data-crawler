By default, GitHub stores build logs and artifacts for 90 days, and you can customize this retention period, depending on the type of repository. For more information, see [Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-retention-period-for-github-actions-artifacts-and-logs-in-your-repository).
Read access to the repository is required to perform these steps.
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  2. Under your repository name, click

  3. In the left sidebar, click the workflow you want to see.

To learn more about GitHub CLI, see [About GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli).
GitHub CLI will download each artifact into separate directories based on the artifact name. If only a single artifact is specified, it will be extracted into the current directory.
To download all artifacts generated by a workflow run, use the `run download` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run that you want to download artifacts from. If you don't specify a `run-id`, GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent run.
```
gh run download RUN_ID

```

To download a specific artifact from a run, use the `run download` subcommand. Replace `run-id` with the ID of the run that you want to download artifacts from. Replace `artifact-name` with the name of the artifact that you want to download.
```
gh run download RUN_ID -n ARTIFACT_NAME

```

You can specify more than one artifact.
```
gh run download RUN_ID> -n ARTIFACT_NAME-1 -n ARTIFACT_NAME-2

```

To download specific artifacts across all runs in a repository, use the `run download` subcommand.
```
gh run download -n ARTIFACT_NAME-1 ARTIFACT_NAME-2

```
