# Managing the forking policy for your organization
You can allow or prevent the forking of any private repositories owned by your organization.
## Who can use this feature?
Organization owners can manage the forking policy for an organization.
By default, new organizations are configured to disallow the forking of private repositories.
If you allow forking of private repositories at the organization level, you can also configure the ability to fork a specific private repository. For more information, see [Managing the forking policy for your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-repository).
