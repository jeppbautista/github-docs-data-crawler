# Using saved replies
When commenting on an issue or pull request, you can add a saved reply that you've already set up. The saved reply can be the entire comment or if you want to customize it, you can add or delete content.
  1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
  2. Under your repository name, click

  3. Click the desired issue or pull request.
  4. To add a saved reply, above the comment field, select 
![Screenshot of a GitHub comment box. On the toolbar, a reply button with a left-facing curved arrow is outlined in dark orange.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-90422/images/help/writing/saved-replies-button.png)
  5. From the list, select the saved reply you'd like to add to your comment. Optionally, edit the content of the saved reply.
  6. Select **Comment** to add your comment.


  * You can use a keyboard shortcut to autofill the comment with a saved reply. For more information, see [Keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/keyboard-shortcuts#comments).
