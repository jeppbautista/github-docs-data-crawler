Setting up your GitHub Copilot Business trial involves three phases, and each phase must be completed by different people.
### [1. Configuring GitHub Copilot Business for your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-the-github-enterprise-cloud-trial#1-configuring-github-copilot-business-for-your-enterprise)
As an **enterprise owner** , you must first configure GitHub Copilot Business for your enterprise. This phase involves setting policies for the use of GitHub Copilot Business in your enterprise, and deciding which organizations in your enterprise can use GitHub Copilot Business. For detailed instructions, see [Setting up GitHub Copilot for your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/setting-up-github-copilot/setting-up-github-copilot-for-your-enterprise).
### [2. Enabling GitHub Copilot Business for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-the-github-enterprise-cloud-trial#2-enabling-github-copilot-business-for-your-organization)
Next, **organization owners** can enable GitHub Copilot Business for their organizations. For detailed instructions, see [Setting up GitHub Copilot for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/setting-up-github-copilot/setting-up-github-copilot-for-your-organization).
### [3. Enabling GitHub Copilot Business for individual users](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-the-github-enterprise-cloud-trial#3-enabling-github-copilot-business-for-individual-users)
If your **personal account** has been granted a seat in an organization that has enabled GitHub Copilot Business, you can now enable GitHub Copilot Business for your personal account. For detailed instructions, see [Setting up GitHub Copilot for yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/setting-up-github-copilot/setting-up-github-copilot-for-yourself).
