This article applies to installing and purchasing apps from GitHub Marketplace only. For more information on apps purchased from integrators, see [About using integrations](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-integrations/about-integrations).
If you choose a paid plan, you'll pay for your app subscription on your personal account's current billing date using your existing payment method.
If you choose a paid plan with a free trial, you can cancel at any time during your trial period without being charged, but you will automatically lose access to the app. Your paid subscription will start at the end of the 14-day trial. For more information, see [About billing for GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-marketplace-apps/about-billing-for-github-marketplace).
