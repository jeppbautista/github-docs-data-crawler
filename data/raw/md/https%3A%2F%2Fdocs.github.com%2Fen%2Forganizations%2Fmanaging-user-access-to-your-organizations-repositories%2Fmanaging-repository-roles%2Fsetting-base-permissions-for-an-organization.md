## [About base permissions for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/setting-base-permissions-for-an-organization#about-base-permissions-for-an-organization)
You can set base permissions that apply to all members of an organization when accessing any of the organization's repositories. Base permissions do not apply to outside collaborators.
By default, members of an organization will have **Read** permissions to the organization's public repositories.
If someone with admin access to an organization's repository grants a member a higher level of access for the repository, the higher level of access overrides the base permission.
  * All changes to base permissions will affect both new and existing members.
  * When you change base permissions for an organization, permissions for private forks are not automatically updated.
