# Requesting to add a child team
If you have maintainer permissions in a team, you can request to nest an existing team under your team in your organization’s hierarchy.
When you request to add a team as a child, a request is sent to the maintainers of the child team. Once a maintainer of the child team approves your request, the child team is nested under the parent team in your organization's hierarchy.
If you're an organization owner or you have team maintainer permissions in both the child team and the parent team, you can add the child team without requesting approval or change the child team's parent from the child team's settings page. For more information, see [Moving a team in your organization’s hierarchy](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/moving-a-team-in-your-organizations-hierarchy).
Child teams inherit the access permissions of the parent team. For more information on team hierarchies, see [About teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams#nested-teams).
