You can add sub-issues to an issue to quickly break down larger pieces of work into tasks. Sub-issues add support for hierarchies of issues on GitHub by creating relationships between your issues. You can create multiple levels of sub-issues that accurately represent your project by breaking down tasks into exactly the amount of detail that you and your team require.
## [Navigating issue hierarchy](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/browsing-sub-issues#navigating-issue-hierarchy)
You can browse through all levels of sub-issues from the parent issue.
  1. Navigate to the parent issue.
  2. To view the sub-issues under another sub-issue, click the expand toggle (

## [Finding a sub-issue's parent issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/browsing-sub-issues#finding-a-sub-issues-parent-issue)
When you view a sub-issue, you can always find a link back to the parent issue in the header below the issue title.

## [Using sub-issues in your projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/browsing-sub-issues#using-sub-issues-in-your-projects)
You can add sub-issues to your projects and make use of the hierarchy data for building views, grouping items, and filtering your views.
