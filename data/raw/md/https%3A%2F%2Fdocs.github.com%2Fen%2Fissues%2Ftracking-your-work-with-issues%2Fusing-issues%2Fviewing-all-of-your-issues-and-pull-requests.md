# Viewing all issues and pull requests
The Issues and Pull Request dashboards list the open issues and pull requests you've created, as well as your saved views. You can use them to update items that have gone stale, close them, or keep track of where you've been mentioned across all repositoriesâ€”including those you're not subscribed to.
