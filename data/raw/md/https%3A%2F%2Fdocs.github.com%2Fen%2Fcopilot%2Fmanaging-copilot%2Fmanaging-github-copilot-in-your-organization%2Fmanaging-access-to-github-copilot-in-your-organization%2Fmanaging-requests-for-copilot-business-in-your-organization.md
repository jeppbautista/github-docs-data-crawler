# Managing requests for Copilot Business in your organization
Approve or deny requests for Copilot access in your organization.
## Who can use this feature?

  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Under "Organizations", next to the name of your organization, click **Settings**.
  3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click 
  4. To accept the request and grant the member access to GitHub Copilot Business, click **Buy Copilot Business**.
