GitHub stores repository and profile metadata from your personal account's activity. You can export your personal account's data through your account settings on GitHub or with the User Migration API.
For more information about the data GitHub stores that is available for exporting, see [REST API endpoints for migrations](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/migrations#download-a-user-migration-archive).
When you request an export of your personal data through your account settings on GitHub, GitHub packages your personal data in a `tar.gz` file and sends you an email to your primary email address with a download link.
By default, the download link expires after seven days. At any time before the download link expires, you can disable the link from your user settings. For more information, see [Requesting an archive of your personal account’s data](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/archiving-your-github-personal-account-and-public-repositories/requesting-an-archive-of-your-personal-accounts-data#deleting-access-to-an-archive-of-your-personal-accounts-data).
If your operating system cannot natively unpack the `tar.gz` file, you can use a third-party tool to extract the archived files. For more information, see [How to unzip a tar.gz file](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/how-unzip-targz-file) on Opensource.com.
The generated `tar.gz` file reflects the data stored at the time you started the data export.
