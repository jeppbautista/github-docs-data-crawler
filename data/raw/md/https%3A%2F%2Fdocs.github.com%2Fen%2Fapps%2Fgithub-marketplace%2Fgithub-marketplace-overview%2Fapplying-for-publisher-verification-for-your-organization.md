This article applies to publishing apps in GitHub Marketplace only. For more information about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see [Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace).
Publisher verification ensures that GitHub has a way to contact you, that you've enabled two-factor authentication for your organization, and that your organization's domain has been verified.
Once your organization has been verified, you can publish paid plans for your app. For information, see [Setting pricing plans for your listing](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing).
To offer paid plans for your app, the app must be owned by an organization and you must have owner permissions in the organization. If your app is currently owned by a personal account, you'll need to transfer the ownership of the app to an organization. For more information, see [Transferring ownership of a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app) or [Transferring ownership of an OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/transferring-ownership-of-an-oauth-app).
