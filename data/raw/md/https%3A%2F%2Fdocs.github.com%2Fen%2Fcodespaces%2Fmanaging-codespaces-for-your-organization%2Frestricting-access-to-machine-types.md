# Restricting access to machine types
You can set constraints on the types of machines users can choose when they create codespaces in your organization.
## Who can use this feature?
To manage access to machine types for the repositories in an organization, you must be an owner of the organization.
Organizations on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise plans can pay for members' and collaborators' use of GitHub Codespaces. These organizations can then access settings and policies to manage codespaces paid for by the organization. For more information, see [Choosing who owns and pays for codespaces in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/choosing-who-owns-and-pays-for-codespaces-in-your-organization#about-ownership-of-codespaces) and [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).

## [Overview](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-access-to-machine-types#overview)
Typically, when you create a codespace you are offered a choice of specifications for the machine that will run your codespace. You can choose the machine type that best suits your needs. For more information, see [Creating a codespace for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).
If you pay for using GitHub Codespaces then your choice of machine type will affect how much you are billed. The compute cost for a codespace is proportional to the number of processor cores in the machine type you choose. For example, the compute cost of using a codespace for an hour on a 16-core machine is eight times greater than a 2-core machine. For more information about pricing, see [About billing for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces).
As an organization owner, you may want to configure constraints on the types of machine that are available. For example, if the work in your organization doesn't require significant compute power or storage space, you can remove the highly resourced machines from the list of options that people can choose from. You do this by defining one or more policies in the GitHub Codespaces settings for your organization.
### [Behavior when you set a machine type constraint](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-access-to-machine-types#behavior-when-you-set-a-machine-type-constraint)
If there are existing codespaces that no longer conform to a policy you have defined, these codespaces will continue to operate until they are stopped or time out. When the user attempts to resume the codespace they are shown a message telling them that the currently selected machine type is no longer allowed for this organization and prompting them to choose an alternative machine type.
If you remove higher specification machine types that are required by the GitHub Codespaces configuration for an individual repository in your organization, then it won't be possible to create a codespace for that repository. When someone attempts to create a codespace they will see a message telling them that there are no valid machine types available that meet the requirements of the repository's GitHub Codespaces configuration.
Anyone who can edit the `devcontainer.json` configuration file in a repository can set a minimum specification for machines that can be used for codespaces for that repository. For more information, see [Setting a minimum specification for codespace machines](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/configuring-dev-containers/setting-a-minimum-specification-for-codespace-machines).
If setting a policy for machine types prevents people from using GitHub Codespaces for a particular repository there are two options:
  * You can adjust your policies to specifically remove the restrictions from the affected repository.
  * Anyone who has a codespace that they can no longer access, because of the new policy, can export their codespace to a branch. This branch will contain all of their changes from the codespace. They can then open a new codespace on this branch with a compliant machine type or work on this branch locally. For more information, see [Exporting changes to a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/troubleshooting/exporting-changes-to-a-branch).


### [Setting organization-wide and repository-specific policies](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-access-to-machine-types#setting-organization-wide-and-repository-specific-policies)
When you create a policy you choose whether it applies to all repositories in your organization, or only to specified repositories. If you set an organization-wide policy then any policies you set for individual repositories must fall within the restriction set at the organization level. Adding policies makes the choice of machine more, not less, restrictive.
For example, you could create an organization-wide policy that restricts the machine types to either 2 or 4 cores. You can then set a policy for Repository A that restricts it to just 2-core machines. Setting a policy for Repository A that restricted it to machines with 2, 4, or 8 cores would result in a choice of 2-core and 4-core machines only, because the organization-wide policy prevents access to 8-core machines.
If you add an organization-wide policy, you should set it to the largest choice of machine types that will be available for any repository in your organization. You can then add repository-specific policies to further restrict the choice.
Codespaces policies only apply to codespaces that your organizations pays for. If someone creates a codespace for a repository in your organization at their own expense, then the codespace will not be bound by these policies. For more information, see [Choosing who owns and pays for codespaces in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/choosing-who-owns-and-pays-for-codespaces-in-your-organization).
## [Adding a policy to limit the available machine types](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-access-to-machine-types#adding-a-policy-to-limit-the-available-machine-types)
  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Next to the organization, click **Settings**.
  3. In the "Code, planning, and automation" section of the sidebar, select **Policies**.
  4. On the "Codespaces policies" page, click **Create Policy**.
  5. Enter a name for your new policy.
  6. Click **Add constraint** and choose **Machine types**.
  7. Click 
![Screenshot of the "Allowed values" dropdown with options for four machine types. The options for 2-core and 4-core machines are selected.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59687/images/help/codespaces/edit-machine-constraint.png)
  8. Click outside of the dialog box to close it.
  9. By default the policy is set to apply to all repositories, if you want it to apply only to some of the repositories in your organization, click **All repositories** and then click **Selected repositories** in the dropdown menu.
![Screenshot of the repository selection dropdown, showing the options "All repositories" and "Selected repositories."](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-48372/images/help/codespaces/selected-repositories.png)
If you're adding a constraint to an existing policy that already contains the "Maximum codespaces per user" constraint, you won't be able to apply the policy to selected repositories. This is because the "Maximum codespaces per user" constraint always applies to all repositories in the organization.
With **Selected repositories** selected:
    1. Click 
![Screenshot of the settings icon \(a gear symbol\) to the left of a button labeled "Selected repositories."](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-7694/images/help/codespaces/policy-edit.png)
    2. Select the repositories you want this policy to apply to.
    3. At the bottom of the repository list, click **Select repositories**.
![Screenshot of a list of repositories, each with a checkbox. Three repositories are selected.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-53629/images/help/codespaces/policy-select-repos.png)
  10. If you want to add another constraint to the policy, click **Add constraint** and choose another constraint. For information about other constraints, see:
     * [Restricting the number of organization-billed codespaces a user can create](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-the-number-of-organization-billed-codespaces-a-user-can-create)
     * [Restricting the base image for codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/restricting-the-base-image-for-codespaces)
