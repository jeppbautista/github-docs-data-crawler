# About global security advisories
Global security advisories live in the GitHub Advisory Database, a collection of CVEs and GitHub-originated advisories affecting the open source world. You can contribute to improving global security advisories.
## [About global security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-global-security-advisories#about-global-security-advisories)
There are two types of advisories: global security advisories and repository security advisories. For more information about repository security advisories, see [About repository security advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories).
Global security advisories are grouped into these categories: GitHub-reviewed advisories, unreviewed advisories, and malware advisories.
  * GitHub-reviewed advisories are security vulnerabilities that have been mapped to packages in ecosystems we support. We carefully review each advisory for validity and ensure that they have a full description, and contain both ecosystem and package information.
  * Unreviewed advisories are security vulnerabilities that we publish automatically into the GitHub Advisory Database, directly from the National Vulnerability Database feed.
  * Malware advisories relate to vulnerabilities caused by malware, and are security advisories that GitHub publishes automatically into the GitHub Advisory Database, directly from information provided by the npm security team. Malware advisories are exclusive to the npm ecosystem. GitHub doesn't edit or accept community contributions on these advisories.


Dependabot doesn't generate Dependabot alerts for unreviewed and malware advisories.
For more information about the GitHub Advisory Database, see [About the GitHub Advisory database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-the-github-advisory-database).
Security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories) are considered global advisories. Anyone can suggest improvements on any global security advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database. You can edit or add any detail, including additionally affected ecosystems, severity level or description of who is impacted. The GitHub Security Lab curation team will review the submitted improvements and publish them onto the GitHub Advisory Database if accepted.
Every repository advisory is reviewed by the GitHub Security Lab curation team for consideration as a global advisory. We publish security advisories for any of the ecosystems supported by the dependency graph to the GitHub Advisory Database on [github.com/advisories](https://github.com/advisories).
You can access any advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database.
