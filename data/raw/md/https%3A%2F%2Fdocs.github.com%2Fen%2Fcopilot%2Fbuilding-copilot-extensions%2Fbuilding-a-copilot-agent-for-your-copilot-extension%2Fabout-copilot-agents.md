# About Copilot agents
Learn what GitHub Copilot agents are and how they can enhance your GitHub Copilot Chat experience.
Copilot agents are custom tools embedded in Copilot Extensions. They integrate with Copilot Chat to provide additional functionalities tailored to specific needs. Copilot agents can perform various tasks such as querying documentation, retrieving data, executing specific actions, or providing AI-assisted coding suggestions. They enhance the capabilities of GitHub Copilot by allowing developers to build and integrate custom features directly into the Copilot Chat interface.
To use a Copilot agent in Copilot Chat, it must be associated with a GitHub App. This combination of a GitHub App and a Copilot agent is what we refer to as a GitHub Copilot Extension. For more information on Copilot Extensions, see [About building Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/about-building-copilot-extensions).
Any GitHub user can create a Copilot Extension by building a Copilot agent and associating it with a GitHub App. For more information on creating a Copilot Extension, see [Setting up Copilot Extensions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/setting-up-copilot-extensions).
