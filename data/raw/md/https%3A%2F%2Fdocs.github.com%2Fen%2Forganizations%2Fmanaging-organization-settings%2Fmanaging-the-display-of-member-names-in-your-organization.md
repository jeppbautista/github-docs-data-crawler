# Managing the display of member names in your organization
You can allow members of your organization to see a comment author's profile name in private repositories in the organization.
## Who can use this feature?
Allowing members to see comment authors' profile names is available with GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans).
Organization owners can manage the display of member names in an organization.

Changes to the display of usernames within an organization will affect the display of other people's usernames, not your own. Each organization member chooses their own profile name in their settings. For more information, see [Personalizing your profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#changing-your-profile-name).
  1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click 
  2. Next to the organization, click **Settings**.
  3. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click 
  4. Under "Repository Comments", select or deselect **Allow members to see comment author's profile name in private repositories**.
  5. Click **Save**.
