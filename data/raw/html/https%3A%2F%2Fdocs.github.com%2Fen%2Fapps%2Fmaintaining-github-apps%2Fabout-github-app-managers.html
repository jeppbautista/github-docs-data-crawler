<p>Organization owners can designate other users in their organization as GitHub App managers. GitHub App managers can manage the settings of some or all of the GitHub App registrations that are owned by the organization. The GitHub App manager role does not grant users access to install and uninstall GitHub Apps on an organization. For more information about the specific app settings that a GitHub App manager can control, see <a href="/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/modifying-a-github-app">Modifying a GitHub App registration</a>.</p>
