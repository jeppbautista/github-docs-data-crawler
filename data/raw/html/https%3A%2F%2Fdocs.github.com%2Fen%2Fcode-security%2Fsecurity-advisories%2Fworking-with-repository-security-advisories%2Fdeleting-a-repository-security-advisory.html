This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as an owner of a public repository.</p>
<p>Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at <a href="https://github.com/advisories">github.com/advisories</a>. Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database">Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you publish a security advisory in error, you can delete the security advisory by contacting us through the <a href="https://support.github.com">GitHub Support portal</a>.</p>
