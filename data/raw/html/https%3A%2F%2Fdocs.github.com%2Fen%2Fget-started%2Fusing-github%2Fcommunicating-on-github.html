<h2><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>GitHub provides built-in collaborative communication tools allowing you to interact closely with your community. This quickstart guide will show you how to pick the right tool for your needs.</p>
<p>You can create and participate in issues, pull requests, and team discussions, depending on the type of conversation you'd like to have.</p>
<div>
<p> You can also use Copilot Chat to generate ideas, outlines, or drafts for discussions, based on your pull requests and issues. See <a href="/en/copilot/copilot-chat-cookbook/documenting-code/writing-discussions-or-blog-posts">Writing discussions or blog posts</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#github-issues">GitHub Issues</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Are useful for discussing specific details of a project such as bug reports, planned improvements and feedback</li>
<li>Are specific to a repository, and usually have a clear owner</li>
<li>Are often referred to as GitHub's bug-tracking system</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#pull-requests">Pull requests</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow you to propose specific changes</li>
<li>Allow you to comment directly on proposed changes suggested by others</li>
<li>Are specific to a repository</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#github-discussions">GitHub Discussions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Are like a forum, and are best used for open-form ideas and discussions where collaboration is important</li>
<li>May span many repositories</li>
<li>Provide a collaborative experience outside the codebase, allowing the brainstorming of ideas, and the creation of a community knowledge base</li>
<li>Often don’t have a clear owner</li>
<li>Often do not result in an actionable task</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#scenarios-for-issues">Scenarios for issues</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>I want to keep track of tasks, enhancements and bugs.</li>
<li>I want to file a bug report.</li>
<li>I want to share feedback about a specific feature.</li>
<li>I want to ask a question about files in the repository.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="#issue-example">Issue example</a></h4>
<p>This example illustrates how a GitHub user created an issue in our documentation open source repository to make us aware of a bug, and discuss a fix.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-435865/images/help/issues/issue-example.png" alt='Screenshot of an issue, with the title "Blue link text in notices is unreadable due to blue background."' width="720" height="479"></source></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>A user noticed that the blue color of the banner at the top of the page in the Chinese version of the GitHub Docs makes the text in the banner unreadable.</li>
<li>The user created an issue in the repository, stating the problem and suggesting a fix (which is, use a different background color for the banner).</li>
<li>A discussion ensues, and eventually, a consensus will be reached about the fix to apply.</li>
<li>A contributor can then create a pull request with the fix.</li>
</ul>

<li>This contributor notices a typo in the repository.</li>
<li>The user creates a pull request with the fix.</li>
<li>A repository maintainer reviews the pull request, comments on it, and merges it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#scenarios-for-github-discussions">Scenarios for GitHub Discussions</a></h3>

<h2><a href="#next-steps">Next steps</a></h2>
<p>These examples showed you how to decide which is the best tool for your conversations on GitHub. But this is only the beginning; there is so much more you can do to tailor these tools to your needs.</p>
<p>For issues, for example, you can tag issues with labels for quicker searching and create issue templates to help contributors open meaningful issues. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues#working-with-issues">About issues</a> and <a href="/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates">About issue and pull request templates</a>.</p>
<p>For pull requests, you can create draft pull requests if your proposed changes are still a work in progress. Draft pull requests cannot be merged until they're marked as ready for review. For more information, see <a href="/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests">About pull requests</a>.</p>
<p>For GitHub Discussions, you can set up a code of conduct and pin discussions that contain important information for your community. For more information, see <a href="/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions">About discussions</a>.</p>
