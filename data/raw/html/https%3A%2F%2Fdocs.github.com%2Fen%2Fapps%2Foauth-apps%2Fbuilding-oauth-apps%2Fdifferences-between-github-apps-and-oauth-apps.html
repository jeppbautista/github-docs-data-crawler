<h2><a href="#about-github-apps-and-oauth-apps">About GitHub Apps and OAuth apps</a></h2>
<p>In general, GitHub Apps are preferred over OAuth apps. GitHub Apps use fine-grained permissions, give the user more control over which repositories the app can access, and use short-lived tokens. These properties can harden the security of your app by limiting the damage that could be done if your app's credentials were leaked.</p>
<p>Similar to OAuth apps, GitHub Apps can still use OAuth 2.0 and generate a type of OAuth token (called a user access token) and take actions on behalf of a user. However, GitHub Apps can also act independently of a user. This is beneficial for automations that do not require user input. The app will continue to work even if the person who installed the app on an organization leaves the organization.</p>
<p>GitHub Apps have built-in, centralized webhooks. GitHub Apps can receive webhook events for all repositories and organizations the app can access. Conversely, OAuth apps must configure webhooks individually for each repository and organization.</p>
<p>The rate limit for GitHub Apps using an installation access token scales with the number of repositories and number of organization users. Conversely, OAuth apps have lower rate limits and do not scale.</p>
<p>There is one case where an OAuth app is preferred over a GitHub App. If your app needs to access enterprise-level resources such as the enterprise object itself, you should use an OAuth app because a GitHub App cannot yet be given permissions against an enterprise. GitHub Apps can still access enterprise-owned organization and repository resources.</p>

<p>For more information about migrating an existing OAuth app to a GitHub App, see <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/guides/migrating-oauth-apps-to-github-apps">Migrating OAuth apps to GitHub Apps</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#who-can-install-github-apps-and-authorize-oauth-apps">Who can install GitHub Apps and authorize OAuth apps?</a></h2>
<p>You can install GitHub Apps in your personal account or organizations you own. If you have admin permissions in a repository, you can install GitHub Apps on organization accounts. If a GitHub App is installed in a repository and requires organization permissions, the organization owner must approve the application.</p>
<p>By default, only organization owners can manage the settings of GitHub Apps in an organization. To allow additional users to change the developer settings of GitHub Apps owned by the organization, an owner can grant them GitHub App manager permissions. GitHub App Managers can't manage third-party applications. For more information about adding and removing GitHub App managers in your organization, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#github-app-managers">Roles in an organization</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, users authorize OAuth apps, which gives the app the ability to act as the authenticated user. For example, you can authorize an OAuth app that finds all notifications for the authenticated user. You can always revoke permissions from an OAuth app.</p>
<p>Organization owners can choose whether to allow outside collaborators to request access for unapproved OAuth apps and GitHub Apps. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/limiting-oauth-app-and-github-app-access-requests">Limiting OAuth app and GitHub App access requests</a>.</p>

<p>
Revoking all permission from an OAuth app deletes any SSH keys the application generated on behalf of the user, including <a href="/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#deploy-keys">deploy keys</a>.</p>

<p>Account owners can use a GitHub App in one account without granting access to another. For example, you can install a third-party build service on your employer's organization, but decide not to grant that build service access to repositories in your personal account. A GitHub App remains installed if the person who set it up leaves the organization.</p>
<p>An <em>authorized</em> OAuth app has access to all of the user's or organization owner's accessible resources.</p>

<h2><a href="#requesting-permission-levels-for-resources">Requesting permission levels for resources</a></h2>
<p>Unlike OAuth apps, GitHub Apps have targeted permissions that allow them to request access only to what they need. For example, a Continuous Integration (CI) GitHub App can request read access to repository content and write access to the status API. Another GitHub App can have no read or write access to code but still have the ability to manage issues, labels, and milestones. OAuth apps can't use granular permissions.</p>
