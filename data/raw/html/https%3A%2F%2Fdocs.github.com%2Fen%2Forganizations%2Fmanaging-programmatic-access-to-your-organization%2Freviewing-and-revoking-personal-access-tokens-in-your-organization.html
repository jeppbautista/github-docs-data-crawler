<h2><a href="#about-reviewing-and-revoking-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens">About reviewing and revoking fine-grained personal access tokens</a></h2>
<p>Organization owners can view all fine-grained personal access tokens that can access resources owned by the organization. Organization owners can also revoke access by fine-grained personal access tokens. When a fine-grained personal access token is revoked, SSH keys created by the token will continue to work and the token will still be able to read public resources within the organization.</p>
<p>When a token is revoked, the user who created the token will receive an email notification.</p>
<p>Organization owners can only view and revoke fine-grained personal access tokens in this UI, not personal access tokens (classic). Unless the organization has restricted access by personal access tokens (classic), any personal access token (classic) can access organization resources until the token expires. For more information about restricting access by personal access tokens (classic), see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization">Setting a personal access token policy for your organization</a>.</p>
<p>Organization owners can also use the REST API to review and revoke fine-grained personal access tokens. These endpoints can only be called by GitHub Apps, and cannot be called with personal access tokens or OAuth apps. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/orgs/orgs#list-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-with-access-to-organization-resources">REST API endpoints for organizations</a>.</p>
