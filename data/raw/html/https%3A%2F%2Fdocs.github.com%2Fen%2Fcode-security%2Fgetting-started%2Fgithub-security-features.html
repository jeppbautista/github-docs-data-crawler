<h2><a href="#about-githubs-security-features">About GitHub's security features</a></h2>
<p>GitHub's security features help keep your code and secrets secure in repositories and across organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some features are available for all GitHub plans.</li>
<li>Additional features are available to organizations  on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud that purchase a GitHub Advanced Security product:
<ul>
<li><a href="#available-with-github-secret-protection">GitHub Secret Protection</a></li>
<li><a href="#available-with-github-code-security">GitHub Code Security</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, a number of GitHub Secret Protection and GitHub Code Security features can be run on public repositories for free.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#available-for-all-github-plans">Available for all GitHub plans</a></h2>
<p>The following security features are available for you to use, regardless of the GitHub plan you are on. You don't need to purchase GitHub Secret Protection or GitHub Code Security to use these features.</p>
<p>Most of these features are available for public and private repositories.
Some features are <em>only</em> available for public repositories.</p>
<h3><a href="#security-policy">Security policy</a></h3>
<p>Make it easy for your users to confidentially report security vulnerabilities they've found in your repository. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository">Adding a security policy to your repository</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#dependency-graph">Dependency graph</a></h3>
<p>The dependency graph allows you to explore the ecosystems and packages that your repository depends on and the repositories and packages that depend on your repository.</p>
<p>You can find the dependency graph on the <strong>Insights</strong> tab for your repository. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph">About the dependency graph</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#software-bill-of-materials-sbom">Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)</a></h3>
<p>You can export the dependency graph of your repository as an SPDX-compatible, Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exporting-a-software-bill-of-materials-for-your-repository">Exporting a software bill of materials for your repository</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#github-advisory-database">GitHub Advisory Database</a></h3>
<p>The GitHub Advisory Database contains a curated list of security vulnerabilities that you can view, search, and filter. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database">Browsing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#dependabot-alerts-and-security-updates">Dependabot alerts and security updates</a></h3>
<p>View alerts about dependencies that are known to contain security vulnerabilities, and choose whether to have pull requests generated automatically to update these dependencies. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts">About Dependabot alerts</a>
and <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates">About Dependabot security updates</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use default Dependabot auto-triage rules curated by GitHub to automatically filter out a substantial amount of false positives.</p>
<p>For an overview of the different features offered by Dependabot and instructions on how to get started, see <a href="/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide">Dependabot quickstart guide</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#dependabot-version-updates">Dependabot version updates</a></h3>
<p>Use Dependabot to automatically raise pull requests to keep your dependencies up-to-date. This helps reduce your exposure to older versions of dependencies. Using newer versions makes it easier to apply patches if security vulnerabilities are discovered, and also makes it easier for Dependabot security updates to successfully raise pull requests to upgrade vulnerable dependencies. You can also customize Dependabot version updates to streamline their integration into your repositories. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates">About Dependabot version updates</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#security-advisories">Security advisories</a></h3>
<p>Privately discuss and fix security vulnerabilities in your public repository's code. You can then publish a security advisory to alert your community to the vulnerability and encourage community members to upgrade. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories">About repository security advisories</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#repository-rulesets">Repository rulesets</a></h3>
<p>Enforce consistent code standards, security, and compliance across branches and tags. For more information, see <a href="/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets">About rulesets</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#artifact-attestations">Artifact attestations</a></h3>
<p>Create unfalsifiable provenance and integrity guarantees for the software you build. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds">Using artifact attestations to establish provenance for builds</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
If you are on a GitHub Free, GitHub Pro, or GitHub Team plan, artifact attestations are only available for public repositories. To use artifact attestations in private or internal repositories, you must be on a GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan.</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#secret-scanning-alerts-for-partners">Secret scanning alerts for partners</a></h3>
<p>When GitHub detects a leaked secret in a public repository, or a public npm packages, GitHub informs the relevant service provider that the secret may be compromised. For details of the supported secrets and service providers, see <a href="/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns#supported-secrets">Supported secret scanning patterns</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#push-protection-for-users">Push protection for users</a></h3>
<p>Push protection for users automatically protects you from accidentally committing secrets to public repositories, regardless of whether the repository itself has secret scanning enabled. Push protection for users is on by default, but you can disable the feature at any time through your personal account settings. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/secret-scanning/working-with-secret-scanning-and-push-protection/push-protection-for-users">Push protection for users</a>.</p>
