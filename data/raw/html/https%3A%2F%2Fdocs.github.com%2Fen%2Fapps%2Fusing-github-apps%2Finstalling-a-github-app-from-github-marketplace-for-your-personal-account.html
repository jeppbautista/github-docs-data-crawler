<h2><a href="#about-github-marketplace">About GitHub Marketplace</a></h2>
<p>This article applies to installing and purchasing GitHub Apps from GitHub Marketplace. For more information on installing GitHub Apps from a source other than GitHub Marketplace, see <a href="/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-a-github-app-from-a-third-party">Installing a GitHub App from a third party</a>.</p>
<p>If you install a GitHub App on your personal account and you choose a paid plan, you will pay for your app subscription on your personal account's current billing date using your existing payment method.</p>
<p>If you choose a paid plan with a free trial, you can cancel at any time during your trial period without being charged, but you will automatically lose access to the app. Your paid subscription will start at the end of the 14-day trial. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-marketplace-apps/about-billing-for-github-marketplace">About billing for GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about installing an OAuth app instead of a GitHub App from GitHub Marketplace, see <a href="/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/installing-an-oauth-app-in-your-personal-account">Installing an OAuth app in your personal account</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#about-installing-github-apps">About installing GitHub Apps</a></h2>
<p>In order to use a GitHub App on your repositories or organization, you must install the app on your organization or personal account. You can install the same GitHub App on multiple accounts. For example, if you install the app on your personal account and on a few organizations that you own, you'll be able to use the app on your personal repositories, on the organizations where you installed the app, and on repositories owned by those organizations.</p>
<p>When you install an app, you grant the app permission to access the organization and repository resources that it requested. During the installation process, GitHub will tell you which permissions the GitHub App requested. For more information about the REST API requests the GitHub App can make with those permissions, see <a href="/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps">Permissions required for GitHub Apps</a>.</p>
<p>When you install an app, you will also choose which repositories to grant the GitHub App access to.</p>
<p>Before installing a GitHub App, you should ensure you trust the owner of the GitHub App. You should also review the permissions that the GitHub App is requesting and make sure you are comfortable granting those permissions. For more information about the REST API requests the GitHub App can make with those permissions, see <a href="/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps">Permissions required for GitHub Apps</a>.</p>
<p>There is no limit to how many apps you can install.</p>
<h3><a href="#difference-between-installation-and-authorization">Difference between installation and authorization</a></h3>
<p>After you install a GitHub App, you may also be asked to authorize the app.</p>
<p>When you <strong>install</strong> a GitHub App on your account or organization, you grant the app permission to access the organization and repository resources that it requested. You also specify which repositories the app can access. During the installation process, the GitHub App will indicate which repository and organization permissions you are granting. For more information about what different permissions enable a GitHub App to do, see <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app">Choosing permissions for a GitHub App</a>.</p>
<p>For example, you might grant the GitHub App permission to read repository metadata and write issues, and you might grant the GitHub App access to all of your repositories.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-118277/images/github-apps/install-app.png" alt="Screenshot of the page to install a GitHub App. The app requests read access to metadata and write access to issues." width="750" height="980"></source></picture></p>
<p>When you <strong>authorize</strong> a GitHub App, you grant the app access to your GitHub account, based on the account permissions the app requested. During the authorization process, the app will indicate which resources the app can access on your account. When you authorize a GitHub App, you also grant the app permission to act on your behalf.</p>
<p>For example, you might grant the GitHub App permission to read your email addresses and write gists.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-106378/images/github-apps/authorize-app.png" alt="Screenshot of the page to authorize a GitHub App. The app is requesting read access to email and write access to gists." width="750" height="970"></source></picture></p>
<p>You can install a GitHub App without authorizing the app. Similarly, you can authorize the app without installing the app.</p>
<p>For more information about authorizing GitHub Apps, see <a href="/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps">Authorizing GitHub Apps</a>.</p>
