<p>The Standard Terms of Service is an agreement between GitHub and you as an individual. To enter into an agreement with GitHub on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit, or group, organization owners can upgrade to the GitHub Customer Agreement.</p>
<p>You can upgrade to the GitHub Customer Agreement instead of using the Standard Terms of Service to help prevent sensitive information from being exposed.
