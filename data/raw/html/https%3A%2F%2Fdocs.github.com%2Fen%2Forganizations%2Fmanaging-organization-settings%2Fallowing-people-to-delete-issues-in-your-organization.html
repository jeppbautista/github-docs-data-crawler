<p>By default, issues cannot be deleted in an organization's repositories. An organization owner must enable this feature for all of the organization's repositories first.</p>
<p>Once enabled, organization owners and people with admin access in an organization-owned repository can delete issues. People with admin access in a repository include organization members and outside collaborators who were given admin access. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization">Repository roles for an organization</a> and <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/deleting-an-issue">Deleting an issue</a>.</p>
