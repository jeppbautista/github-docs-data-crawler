<div><div><p>You can use milestones to track progress on groups of issues or pull requests in a repository.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div>
<p>When you <a href="/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests">create a milestone</a>, you can <a href="/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/associating-milestones-with-issues-and-pull-requests">associate it with issues and pull requests</a>.</p>
<p>To better manage your project, you can <a href="/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/viewing-your-milestones-progress">view details about your milestone</a>. From the milestone page, you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user-provided description of the milestone, which can include information like a project overview, relevant teams, and projected due dates</li>
<li>The milestone's due date</li>
<li>The milestone's completion percentage</li>
<li>The number of open and closed issues and pull requests associated with the milestone</li>
<li>A list of the open and closed issues and pull requests associated with the milestone</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can edit the milestone from the milestone page and create new issues that are, by default, associated with the milestone.</p>
<h2><a href="#prioritizing-issues-and-pull-requests-in-milestones">Prioritizing issues and pull requests in milestones</a></h2>
<p>You can prioritize open issues and pull requests in a milestone by clicking to the left of an issue or pull request's checkbox, dragging it to a new location, and dropping it.</p>
<div>
<p>
If there are more than 500 open issues in a milestone, you won't be able to prioritize issues.</p>
