<p>For a "marked as duplicate" timeline event to appear, the user who creates the duplicate reference comment must have write access to the repository where they create the comment.</p>
<h2><a href="#marking-duplicates">Marking duplicates</a></h2>
<p>To mark an issue or pull request as a duplicate, type "Duplicate of" followed by an issue or pull request number in the body of a new comment.</p>
<p>You can also use the GitHub-provided saved replies, "Duplicate issue" or "Duplicate pull request." For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-saved-replies/about-saved-replies">About saved replies</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#unmarking-duplicates">Unmarking duplicates</a></h2>
<p>You can unmark duplicate issues and pull requests by clicking <strong>Undo</strong> in the timeline. This will add a new timeline event, indicating that the issue or pull request was unmarked.</p>
