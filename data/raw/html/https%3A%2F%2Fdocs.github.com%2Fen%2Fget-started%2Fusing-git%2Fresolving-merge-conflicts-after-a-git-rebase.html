<div><div><h1>Resolving merge conflicts after a Git rebase</h1></div></div>
<div><div><p>When you perform a <code>git rebase</code> operation, you're typically moving commits around. Because of this, you might get into a situation where a merge conflict is introduced. That means that two of your commits modified the same line in the same file, and Git doesn't know which change to apply.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div>
<p>After you reorder and manipulate commits using <code>git rebase</code>, should a merge conflict occur, Git will tell you so with the following message printed to the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>error: could not apply fa39187... something to add to patch A

When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply fa39187f3c3dfd2ab5faa38ac01cf3de7ce2e841... Change fake file
</code></pre>
<p>Here, Git is telling you which commit is causing the conflict (<code>fa39187</code>). You're given three choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can run <code>git rebase --abort</code> to completely undo the rebase. Git will return you to your branch's state as it was before <code>git rebase</code> was called.</li>
<li>You can run <code>git rebase --skip</code> to completely skip the commit. That means that none of the changes introduced by the problematic commit will be included. It is very rare that you would choose this option.</li>
<li>You can fix the conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix the conflict, you can follow <a href="/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line">the standard procedures for resolving merge conflicts from the command line</a>. When you're finished, you'll need to call <code>git rebase --continue</code> in order for Git to continue processing the rest of the rebase.</p>
