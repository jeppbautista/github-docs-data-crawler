<p>Your repository's Dependabot alerts tab lists all open and closed Dependabot alerts and corresponding Dependabot security updates. You can filter alerts by package, ecosystem, or manifest. You can sort the list of alerts, and you can click into specific alerts for more details. You can also dismiss or reopen alerts, either one by one or by selecting multiple alerts at once. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts">About Dependabot alerts</a>.</p>
<p>You can enable automatic security updates for any repository that uses Dependabot alerts and the dependency graph. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates">About Dependabot security updates</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#about-updates-for-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository">About updates for vulnerable dependencies in your repository</a></h2>
<p>GitHub generates Dependabot alerts when we detect that the default branch of your codebase is using dependencies with known security risks. For repositories where Dependabot security updates are enabled, when GitHub detects a vulnerable dependency in the default branch, Dependabot creates a pull request to fix it. The pull request will upgrade the dependency to the minimum possible secure version needed to avoid the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Dependabot doesn't generate Dependabot alerts for malware. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-the-github-advisory-database#malware-advisories">About the GitHub Advisory database</a>.</p>
<p>Each Dependabot alert has a unique numeric identifier and the Dependabot alerts tab lists an alert for every detected vulnerability. Legacy Dependabot alerts grouped vulnerabilities by dependency and generated a single alert per dependency. If you navigate to a legacy Dependabot alert, you will be redirected to a Dependabot alerts tab filtered for that package.</p>
<p>You can filter and sort Dependabot alerts using a variety of filters and sort options available on the user interface. For more information, see <a href="#prioritizing-dependabot-alerts">Prioritizing Dependabot alerts</a> below.</p>
<p>You can also audit actions taken in response to Dependabot alerts. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/getting-started/auditing-security-alerts">Auditing security alerts</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#prioritizing-dependabot-alerts">Prioritizing Dependabot alerts</a></h2>
<p>GitHub helps you prioritize fixing Dependabot alerts. By default, Dependabot alerts are sorted by importance. The "Most important" sort order helps you prioritize which Dependabot alerts to focus on first. Alerts are ranked based on their potential impact, actionability, and relevance. Our prioritization calculation is constantly being improved and includes factors like CVSS score, dependency scope, and whether vulnerable function calls are found for the alert.
You can also use Dependabot auto-triage rules to prioritize Dependabot alerts. For more information, see “<a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-auto-triage-rules/about-dependabot-auto-triage-rules">About Dependabot auto-triage rules</a>.”</p>
<p>You can sort and filter Dependabot alerts by typing filters as <code>key:value</code> pairs into the search bar.</p>

<div>
<p> The Exploit Prediction Scoring System, or EPSS, provides a <strong>score</strong> (from 0 to 100%) or probability of the vulnerability to be exploited in the next 30 days, and a <strong>percentile</strong> (nth percentile) or relative measure of threat. This score comes from the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) and is updated daily. To learn more, see <a href="https://www.first.org/epss/">Exploit Prediction Scoring System</a> in the FIRST documentation.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition to the filters available via the search bar, you can sort and filter Dependabot alerts using the dropdown menus at the top of the alert list. Alternatively, to filter by label, click a label assigned to an alert to automatically apply that filter to the alert list.</p>
<p>The search bar also allows for full text searching of alerts and related security advisories. You can search for part of a security advisory name or description to return the alerts in your repository that relate to that security advisory. For example, searching for <code>yaml.load() API could execute arbitrary code</code> will return Dependabot alerts linked to <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rprw-h62v-c2w7">PyYAML insecurely deserializes YAML strings leading to arbitrary code execution</a> as the search string appears in the advisory description.</p>

<p>You can also use the REST API to get a list of Dependabot alerts sorted using your filter of choice, for your repository, organization, or enterprise. For more information about API endpoints, see <a href="/en/rest/dependabot/alerts">REST API endpoints for Dependabot alerts</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#reviewing-and-fixing-alerts">Reviewing and fixing alerts</a></h2>
<p>It’s important to ensure that all of your dependencies are clean of any security weaknesses. When Dependabot discovers vulnerabilities in your dependencies, you should assess your project’s level of exposure and determine what remediation steps to take to secure your application.</p>
<p>If a patched version of the dependency is available, you can generate a Dependabot pull request to update this dependency directly from a Dependabot alert. If you have Dependabot security updates enabled, the pull request may be linked in the Dependabot alert.</p>
<p>In cases where a patched version is not available, or you can’t update to the secure version, Dependabot shares additional information to help you determine next steps. When you click through to view a Dependabot alert, you can see the full details of the security advisory for the dependency including the affected functions. You can then check whether your code calls the impacted functions. This information can help you further assess your risk level, and determine workarounds or if you’re able to accept the risk represented by the security advisory.</p>
