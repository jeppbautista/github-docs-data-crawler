<p>The tool status page shows you how well code scanning tools are working for a repository, when files in the repository were first scanned and most recently scanned, and when scans are scheduled. For integrated tools like CodeQL, you can also see more detailed information, including a percentage of files scanned and specific error messages. For more information about the tool status page, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/about-the-tool-status-page">About the tool status page for code scanning</a>.</p>
<p>You can also view the logging output from code scanning runs using GitHub Actions (CodeQL or third-party). For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/viewing-code-scanning-logs#viewing-the-logging-output-from-code-scanning">Viewing code scanning logs</a>.</p>
