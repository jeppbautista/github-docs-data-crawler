<p>You can use issue types to classify and manage different types of issues across your organization. You can create up to 25 issue types that your organization members can apply to issues, making it easier for you and your members to find issues and plan work.</p>
<p>Default issue types are included in every organization, but these can edited, disabled, or deleted. The default types are task, bug, and feature.</p>
<p>When you add an issue type to an issue, the type will be shown on any lists of issues and in the issues themselves. You can filter and search by issue type and use issue types when creating filters and views in your projects. See <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#filtering-by-issue-type">Filtering and searching issues and pull requests</a> and <a href="/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/filtering-projects#filtering-by-issue-type">Filtering projects</a>.</p>
