<h2><a href="#about-organization-invitations">About organization invitations</a></h2>
<p>When you invite someone to become a member of your organization, the person receives an email with an invitation link. To join the organization, the invitee clicks the invitation link in the email.</p>
<p>You can use a person's GitHub username or email address for the invitation.</p>
<div>
<p>
If you use an email address for the invitation, the invitee will only be able to accept the invitation if the email address matches with a verified email address associated with the invitee's personal account on GitHub. For more information, see <a href="/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address">Verifying your email address</a>.</p>
<p>If an invitee's personal account has been flagged, the invitee won't be able to accept any new or pending invitations to join organizations.</p>
</div>
<p>If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can invite a new member to join the organization or reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/about-per-user-pricing">About per-user pricing</a>.</p>
<p>If an invitee does not accept the invitation within seven days, the pending invitation expires automatically.</p>
<p>If your organization requires members to use two-factor authentication, users that you invite must enable two-factor authentication before accepting the invitation. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-two-factor-authentication-for-your-organization/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization">Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization</a> and <a href="/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa">Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)</a>.</p>
<p>Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can implement SCIM to add, manage, and remove organization members' access to GitHub through an identity provider (IdP). For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/about-scim-for-organizations">About SCIM for organizations</a>" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.</p>
<p>To prevent abuse, you can only create 50 organization invitations within a 24-hour period. If your organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.</p>
