<div><div><p>There are some limits on GitHub Actions usage when using self-hosted runners. These limits are subject to change.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Job execution time</strong> - Each job in a workflow can run for up to 5 days of execution time. If a job reaches this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workflow run time</strong> - Each workflow run is limited to 35 days. If a workflow run reaches this limit, the workflow run is cancelled. This period includes execution duration, and time spent on waiting and approval.</li>
<li>
<strong>Job queue time</strong> - Each job for self-hosted runners that has been queued for at least 24 hours will be canceled. The actual time in queue can reach up to 48 hours before cancellation occurs. If a self-hosted runner does not start executing the job within this limit, the job is terminated and fails to complete.</li>
<li>
<strong>API requests</strong> - You can execute up to 1,000 requests to the GitHub API in an hour across all actions within a repository. If requests are exceeded, additional API calls will fail which might cause jobs to fail.</li>
<li>
<strong>Job matrix</strong> - A job matrix can generate a maximum of 256 jobs per workflow run. This limit applies to both GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners.</li>
<li>
<strong>Workflow run queue</strong> - No more than 500 workflow runs can be queued in a 10 second interval per repository. If a workflow run reaches this limit, the workflow run is terminated and fails to complete.</li>
<li>
<strong>Registering self-hosted runners</strong> - You can have a maximum of 10,000 self-hosted runners in one runner group. If this limit is reached, adding a new runner will not be possible.</li>
