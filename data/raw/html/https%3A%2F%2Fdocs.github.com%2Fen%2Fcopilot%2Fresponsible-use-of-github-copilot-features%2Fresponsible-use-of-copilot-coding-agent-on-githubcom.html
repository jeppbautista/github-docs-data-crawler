<h2><a href="#about-copilot-coding-agent-on-githubcom">About Copilot coding agent on GitHub.com</a></h2>
<p>Copilot coding agent is an autonomous and asynchronous software development agent integrated into GitHub. The agent can pick up a task from an issue or from Copilot Chat, create a pull request, and then iterate on the pull request in response to comments.</p>
<p>Copilot coding agent can generate tailored changes based on your description and configurations, including tasks like bug fixes, implementing incremental new features, prototyping, documentation, and codebase maintenance. After the initial pull request is created, the agent can iterate with you, based on your feedback and reviews.</p>
<p>While working on your task, the agent has access to its own ephemeral development environment where it can make changes to your code, execute automated tests, and run linters.</p>
<p>The agent has been evaluated across a variety of programming languages, with English as the primary supported language.</p>
<p>The agent works by using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to understand your task and make changes in a codebase to complete your task. This process can be broken down into a number of steps.</p>
<h3><a href="#prompt-processing">Prompt processing</a></h3>
<p>The task provided to Copilot through an issue, pull request comment or Copilot Chat message is combined with other relevant, contextual information to form a prompt. That prompt is sent to a large language model for processing. Inputs can take the form of plain natural language, code snippets, or images.</p>
<h3><a href="#language-model-analysis">Language model analysis</a></h3>
<p>The prompt is then passed through a large language model, which is a neural network that has been trained on a large body of data. The language model analyzes the input prompt to help the agent reason on the task and leverage necessary tools.</p>
<h3><a href="#response-generation">Response generation</a></h3>
<p>The language model generates a response based on its analysis of the prompt. This response can take the form of natural language suggestions and code suggestions.</p>
<h3><a href="#output-formatting">Output formatting</a></h3>
<p>Once the agent completes its first run, it will update the pull request description with the changes it made. The agent may include supplemental information about resources it could not access and provide suggestions on the steps to resolve.</p>
<p>You may provide feedback to the agent by commenting within the pull request or explicitly mentioning the agent (<code>@copilot</code>). The agent will then resubmit that feedback to the language model for further analysis. Once the agent completes changes based on feedback, the agent will respond to your comment with updated changes.</p>
<p>Copilot is intended to provide you with the most relevant solution for task resolution. However, it may not always provide the answer you are looking for. You are responsible for reviewing and validating responses generated by Copilot to ensure they are accurate and appropriate.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of our product development process, GitHub  undertakes red teaming (testing) to understand and improve the safety of the agent.</p>

<h3><a href="#ensure-your-tasks-are-well-scoped">Ensure your tasks are well-scoped</a></h3>
<p>Copilot coding agent leverages your prompt as key context when generating a pull request. The more clear and well-scoped the prompt you assign to the agent, the better the results you will get. An ideal issue includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear description of the problem to be solved or the work required.</li>
<li>Complete acceptance criteria on what a good solution looks like (for example, should there be unit tests?).</li>
<li>Hints or pointers on what files need to be changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#customize-your-experience-with-additional-context">Customize your experience with additional context</a></h3>
<p>Copilot coding agent leverages your prompt, comments and the repository’s code as context when generating suggested changes. To enhance Copilot’s performance, consider implementing custom Copilot instructions to help the agent better understand your project and how to build, test and validate its changes. For more information, see the "Add custom instructions to your repository" in <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/coding-agent/best-practices-for-using-copilot-to-work-on-tasks#adding-custom-instructions-to-your-repository">Best practices for using Copilot to work on tasks</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="#use-copilot-coding-agent-as-a-tool-not-a-replacement">Use Copilot coding agent as a tool, not a replacement</a></h3>
<p>While Copilot coding agent can be a powerful tool for generating code and documentation, it is important to use it as a tool, rather than a replacement for human programming. You should always review and test the content generated by the agent to ensure that it meets your requirements and is free of errors or security concerns prior to merging.</p>
<h3><a href="#use-secure-coding-and-code-review-practices">Use secure coding and code review practices</a></h3>
<p>Although Copilot coding agent can generate syntactically correct code, it may not always be secure. You should always follow best practices for secure coding, such as avoiding hard-coded passwords or SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as following code review best practices, to address the agent’s limitations. You should always take the same precautions as you would with any code you write that uses material you did not independently originate, including precautions to ensure its suitability. These include rigorous testing, IP scanning, and checking for security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>If you encounter any issues or limitations with Copilot coding agent on GitHub.com, we recommend that you provide feedback by clicking the thumbs down icon below each agent response. This can help the developers to improve the tool and address any concerns or limitations. Additionally, you can provide feedback in the community discussion forum.</p>
<h3><a href="#stay-up-to-date">Stay up to date</a></h3>
<p>Copilot coding agent is a new technology and is likely to evolve over time. You should stay up to date with any new security risks or best practices that may emerge.</p>
<h2><a href="#security-measures-for-copilot-coding-agent">Security measures for Copilot coding agent</a></h2>
<p>By design, Copilot coding agent is built with several mitigations to help ensure your data and codebase is secure. Although mitigations exist, be sure to continue implementing security best practices while understanding the agent’s limitations and how they may impact your code.</p>
<h3><a href="#avoiding-privileged-escalation">Avoiding privileged escalation</a></h3>
<p>Copilot coding agent will only respond to interactions (for example, assigning the agent or commenting) from users with repository write access.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions workflows triggered in response to pull requests raised by Copilot coding agent require approval from a user with repository write access before they will run.</p>
<p>The agent filters hidden characters, that are not displayed on GitHub.com, which might otherwise allow users to hide harmful instructions in comments or issue body contents. This protects against risks like jailbreaks.</p>
<h3><a href="#constraining-copilots-permissions">Constraining Copilot’s permissions</a></h3>
<p>Copilot only has access to the repository where it is creating a pull request, and cannot access other repositories.</p>
<p>Its permissions are limited, allowing it to push code and read other resources. Built-in protections mean that Copilot can only push to branches with names beginning with <code>copilot/</code>. This means that Copilot cannot push to your default branch (for example, <code>main</code>).</p>
<p>Copilot coding agent does not have access to Actions organization or repository secrets or variables during runtime. Only secrets and variables specifically added to the <code>copilot</code> environment are passed to the agent.</p>
<h3><a href="#preventing-data-exfiltration">Preventing data exfiltration</a></h3>
<p>By default, Copilot coding agent has a firewall enabled to prevent exfiltration of code or other sensitive data, either accidentally or due to malicious user input.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/customizing-or-disabling-the-firewall-for-copilot-coding-agent">Customizing or disabling the firewall for Copilot coding agent</a>.</p>
