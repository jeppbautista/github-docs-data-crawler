<thead><tr>
<th>Phase</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Private preview</td>
<td>The product or feature is under heavy development and often has changing requirements and scope. The feature is available for demonstration and test purposes but may not be documented. Private preview releases are not necessarily feature complete, no service level agreements (SLAs) are provided, and there are no technical support obligations. <br><br> <strong>Note:</strong> A product or feature released as a "Technology Preview" is considered to be in the private preview release stage. Technology Preview releases share the same characteristics of private preview releases as described above.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public preview</td>
<td>The product or feature is ready for broader distribution. Public preview releases can be public or private, are documented, but do not have any SLAs or technical support obligations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>General availability (GA)</td>
<td>The product or feature is fully tested and open publicly to all users. GA releases are ready for production use, and associated SLA and technical support obligations apply.</td>
