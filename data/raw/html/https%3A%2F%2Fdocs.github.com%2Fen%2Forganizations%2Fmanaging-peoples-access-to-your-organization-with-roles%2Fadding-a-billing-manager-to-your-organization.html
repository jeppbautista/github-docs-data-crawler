<p> Enterprise accounts, and organizations owned by enterprise accounts, created after June 2, 2024, have access to the new billing platform. Enterprises that participated in the public preview program also have access to the new billing platform.</p>
<p>If you are on the new billing platform, the process for adding a billing manager is different. See <a href="/en/billing/managing-your-billing/roles-for-the-new-billing-platform#inviting-a-billing-manager">Roles for the new billing platform</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The invited person will receive an invitation email asking them to become a billing manager for your organization. Once the invited person clicks the accept link in their invitation email, they will automatically be added to the organization as a billing manager. If they don't already have a GitHub account, they will be directed to sign up for one, and they will be automatically added to the organization as a billing manager after they create an account.</p>
