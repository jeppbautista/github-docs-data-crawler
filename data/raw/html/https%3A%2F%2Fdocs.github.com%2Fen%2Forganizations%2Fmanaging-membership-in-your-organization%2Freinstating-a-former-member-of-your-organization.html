<h2><a href="#about-member-reinstatement">About member reinstatement</a></h2>
<p>If a user is removed from your organization in one of the following ways, the user's access privileges and settings are saved for three months.</p>
<ul>
<li>You manually removed the user from your organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization/removing-a-member-from-your-organization">Removing a member from your organization</a>.</li>
<li>The user was removed from your organization because you've required members and outside collaborators to enable two-factor authentication (2FA). For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/requiring-two-factor-authentication-in-your-organization">Requiring two-factor authentication in your organization</a>.</li>
<li>The user was removed from your organization because you enforced SAML single sign-on. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/enforcing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization">Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization</a>" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.</li>
<li>You converted an organization member to an outside collaborator. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-outside-collaborators/converting-an-organization-member-to-an-outside-collaborator">Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can restore the user's privileges if you invite them back to the organization within that time frame.</p>
<p>If your organization has a paid per-user subscription, an unused license must be available before you can reinstate a former organization member. For more information, see <a href="/en/articles/about-per-user-pricing">About per-user pricing</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#items-that-are-restored-for-reinstated-members">Items that are restored for reinstated members</a></h2>
<p>When you reinstate a former organization member, the following items can be restored:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user's role in the organization</li>
<li>Any private forks of repositories owned by the organization</li>
<li>Membership in the organization's teams</li>
<li>Previous access and permissions for the organization's repositories</li>
<li>Stars for organization repositories</li>
<li>Issue assignments in the organization</li>
<li>Repository subscriptions (notification settings for watching, not watching, or ignoring a repository's activity)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#reinstating-a-former-member-of-your-organization-on-github">Reinstating a former member of your organization on GitHub</a></h2>
<p>If a user was removed from your organization because you required members and outside collaborators to enable 2FA, you can send an invitation to reinstate a user's privileges and access to the organization before they have enabled two-factor authentication, but they must enable 2FA before they can accept your invitation to rejoin the organization.</p>
