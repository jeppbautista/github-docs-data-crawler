<h2><a href="#about-project-visibility">About project visibility</a></h2>
<p>Project visibility can be set to public or private. For public projects, everyone on the internet can view the project. For private projects, only users granted at least read access can see the project.</p>
<p>Only the project visibility is affected; to view an item on the project, someone must have the required permissions for the repository that the item belongs to. Only people with access to a private repository will be able to view project items from that private repository.</p>

<p>Project admins and organization owners can control project visibility. Organization owners can restrict the ability to change project visibility to just organization owners.</p>
<p>In public and private projects, insights are only visible to users with write permissions for the project.</p>
<p>In private organization-owned projects, the avatars of users who are current making updates to the project are displayed in the project UI.</p>
<p>Project admins can also manage write and admin access to their project and control read access for individual users. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects">Managing access to your projects</a>.</p>
