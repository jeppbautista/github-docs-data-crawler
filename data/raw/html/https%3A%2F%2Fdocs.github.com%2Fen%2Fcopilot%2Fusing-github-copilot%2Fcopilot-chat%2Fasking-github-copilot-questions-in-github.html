<h2><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub is a chat interface that lets you ask and receive answers to coding-related questions on the GitHub website.</p>
<p>Copilot Chat can help you with a variety of coding-related tasks, like offering you code suggestions, providing natural language descriptions of a piece of code's functionality and purpose, generating unit tests for your code, and proposing fixes for bugs in your code. For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/copilot-chat-in-github/about-github-copilot-chat-in-githubcom">Asking GitHub Copilot questions in GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>On GitHub, you can use Copilot Chat to ask different questions in different contexts. For example, you can ask about a specific repository, a specific issue, or a specific pull request. You can also ask general questions about software development, or about a specific programming language.</p>
<h3><a href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<p>The quality of the results from Copilot Chat may, in some situations, be degraded if very large files, or a large number of files, are used as a context for a question.</p>
<h3><a href="#viewing-and-editing-generated-files-within-copilot-chat">Viewing and editing generated files within Copilot Chat</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
This feature is currently in public preview and subject to change.</p>
</div>
<p>When you ask a question, Copilot may generate one or more files as part of its response. In the Copilot Chat panel, the files are displayed inline, within the chat response. In immersive view (that is, at <a href="https://github.com/copilot">https://github.com/copilot</a>), the generated files are displayed in a side panel. You can view and edit the files in the panel, or download them to your computer.</p>
<p>For example, asking <code>Generate a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</code> may generate multiple files, such as <code>index.html</code>, <code>styles.css</code>, and <code>script.js</code>.</p>
<p>In immersive view, you can also preview how some file formats, such as Markdown, render by toggling to the "Preview" tab in the side panel.</p>
<h2><a href="#powered-by-skills">Powered by skills</a></h2>
<p>When using the GPT-4o and Claude models, Copilot has access to a collection of skills to fetch data from GitHub, which are dynamically selected based on the question you ask. You can tell which skill Copilot used by clicking </p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-63699/images/help/copilot/chat-show-skill.png" alt="Screenshot of the Copilot chat panel with the status information expanded and the skill that was used highlighted with an orange outline." width="631" height="456"></source></picture></p>
<p>You can explicitly ask GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub to use a particular skill - for example, <code>Use the Bing skill to find the latest GPT4 model from OpenAI</code>.</p>
<p>You can generate a list of currently available skills by asking Copilot: <code>What skills are available?</code></p>
<h2><a href="#customizing-copilot-chat-responses">Customizing Copilot Chat responses</a></h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, the specifics of your project, or your personal preferences, if you provide it with enough context to do so. Instead of repeating instructions in each prompt, you can create and save instructions for Copilot Chat to customize what responses you receive.</p>
<p>There are two types of custom instructions you can add for Copilot Chat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repository instructions: You can create a custom instructions file for a repository, so that all prompts asked in the context of the repository automatically include the instructions you've defined</li>
<li>Personal instructions: You can add personal instructions so that all the chat responses you, as a user, receive are tailored to your preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot">Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot</a> and <a href="/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-personal-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot">Adding personal custom instructions for GitHub Copilot</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#ai-models-for-copilot-chat">AI models for Copilot Chat</a></h2>
<p>You can change the large language model that Copilot uses to generate responses to chat prompts, including premium models with advanced capabilities. You may find that different models perform better, or provide more useful responses, depending on the type of questions you ask. For more information see <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/changing-the-ai-model-for-copilot-chat">Changing the AI model for Copilot Chat</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#submitting-a-question-to-copilot-chat">Submitting a question to Copilot Chat</a></h2>
<p>You can open Copilot Chat from any page on GitHub. Certain questions may require you to be in a specific context, such as a repository, issue, or pull request. The following procedure describes how to ask a general software related question, and demonstrates the core functionality of Copilot Chat on GitHub. For more information on other scenarios, see <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-github#asking-copilot-chat-questions-in-different-contexts">Asking Copilot Chat questions in different contexts</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the question you ask, and your enterprise and organization settings, Copilot may respond using information based on the results of a Bing search. By using Bing search, Copilot can answer a broad range of tech-related questions with up-to-date details based on information currently available on the internet. For information on how to enable or disable Bing search integration, see <a href="/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/managing-copilot-policies-as-an-individual-subscriber#enabling-or-disabling-web-search-for-github-copilot-chat">Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber</a> and <a href="/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-for-your-enterprise/managing-policies-and-features-for-copilot-in-your-enterprise">Managing policies and features for Copilot in your enterprise</a>.</p>
