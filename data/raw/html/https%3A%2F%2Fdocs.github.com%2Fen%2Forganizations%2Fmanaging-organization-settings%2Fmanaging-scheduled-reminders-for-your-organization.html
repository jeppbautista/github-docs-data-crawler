<h2><a href="#about-scheduled-reminders-for-pull-requests">About scheduled reminders for pull requests</a></h2>
<p>Scheduled reminders help teams focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to your team in Slack with all open pull requests that you or your team have been asked to review, at a specified time. For example, you can create a scheduled reminder to send a message to your team's main communication channel in Slack, including all open pull requests that the team is requested to review, every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Organization owners can schedule a reminder for one or more teams in their organization, for all pull requests the team or teams have been requested to review.</p>
<p>GitHub will only trigger reminders for up to five repositories per owner and 20 pull requests per repository. Reminders are not sent when changes are merged from upstream into a fork.</p>
