<p>You can restrict who has the ability to change the visibility of repositories in your organization, such as changing a repository from private to public. For more information about repository visibility, see <a href="/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-repository-visibility">About repositories</a>.</p>
<p>Restricting who has the ability to change the visibility of repositories in your organization helps prevent sensitive information from being exposed. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/getting-started/best-practices-for-preventing-data-leaks-in-your-organization">Best practices for preventing data leaks in your organization</a>.</p>
<p>You can restrict the ability to change repository visibility to organization owners only, or you can allow anyone with admin access to a repository to change visibility.</p>
<div>
<p>
If this setting is enabled, individuals or GitHub Apps with admin access can <em>modify</em> the visibility of an existing repository even if the ability to <em>create</em> a repository with that specific visibility has been disabled. For more information about restricting the visibility of repositories during creation, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/restricting-repository-creation-in-your-organization">Restricting repository creation in your organization</a>.</p>
