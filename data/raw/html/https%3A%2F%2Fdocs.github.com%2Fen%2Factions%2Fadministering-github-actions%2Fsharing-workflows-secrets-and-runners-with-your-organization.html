<h2><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>If you need to share workflows and other GitHub Actions features with your team, then consider collaborating within a GitHub organization. An organization allows you to centrally store and manage secrets, artifacts, and self-hosted runners. You can also create workflow templates in the <code>.github</code> repository and share them with other users in your organization.</p>
<h2><a href="#sharing-workflows">Sharing workflows</a></h2>
<p>Your organization can share workflows by reusing the workflows exactly or by creating workflow templates</p>
<h3><a href="#reusing-workflows">Reusing workflows</a></h3>
<p>You can call one workflow from within another workflow. This allows you to reuse workflows, avoiding duplication and making your workflows easier to maintain. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows">Reusing workflows</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-workflow-templates">Using workflow templates</a></h3>
<p>Workflow templates allow everyone in your organization who has permission to create workflows to do so more quickly and easily. When you create a new workflow, you can choose a workflow template and some or all of the work of writing the workflow will be done for you. You can use workflow templates as a starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is. This not only saves time, it promotes consistency and best practice across your organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization">Creating workflow templates for your organization</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#sharing-secrets-and-variables-within-an-organization">Sharing secrets and variables within an organization</a></h2>
<p>You can centrally manage your secrets and variables within an organization, and then make them available to selected repositories. This also means that you can update a secret or variable in one location, and have the change apply to all repository workflows that use it.</p>
<p>When creating a secret or variable in an organization, you can use a policy to limit which repositories can access it. For example, you can grant access to all repositories, or limit access to only private repositories or a specified list of repositories.</p>
<p>Organization owners can create secrets or variables at the organization level.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under your organization name, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select <strong>Actions</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Secrets</strong> or <strong>Variables</strong> tab, and create the secret or variable with your desired values and options.</p>

<p>Organization owners can add their self-hosted runners to groups, and then create policies that control which repositories can access the group.</p>
