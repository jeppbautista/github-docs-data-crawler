<p>You can block non-members from within your organization's settings or from a specific comment made by a user. When you block a user in a comment, you can choose to send the user a notification explaining that they were blocked and why. Otherwise, the user is not directly notified that you've blocked them. Blocked users can still delete their existing content.</p>
<p>When you block a user, you can choose to block them indefinitely or for a specific amount of time. If you block someone for a specific amount of time, they are automatically unblocked after the chosen time expires. If you block someone indefinitely, you can unblock them manually at any time. For more information, see <a href="/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/unblocking-a-user-from-your-organization">Unblocking a user from your organization</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
If you're blocking a user because of a heated conversation, consider locking the conversation so only collaborators can comment. For more information, see <a href="/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/locking-conversations">Locking conversations</a>.</p>

<p>At the time that you block a user from your organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user stops watching your organization's repositories</li>
<li>The user's stars and issue assignments are removed from your repositories</li>
<li>The user's votes on discussions or comments in your organization's repositories are deleted</li>
<li>The user is removed as a collaborator on your organization's repositories</li>
<li>The user's contributions to your organization's repositories are no longer counted as contributions for them</li>
<li>Any pending repository or organization invitations to the blocked user are canceled</li>
</ul>
<p>After you've blocked a user from your organization, they cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-reference your organization's repositories in comments</li>
<li>Fork, watch, pin, or star your organization's repositories</li>
</ul>
<p>In your organization's repositories, blocked users also cannot:</p>
