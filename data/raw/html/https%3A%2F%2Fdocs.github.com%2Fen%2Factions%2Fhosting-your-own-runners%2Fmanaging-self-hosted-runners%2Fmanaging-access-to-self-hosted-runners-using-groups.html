<h2><a href="#about-runner-groups">About runner groups</a></h2>
<p>To control access to runners at the organization level, organizations using the GitHub Team plan can use runner groups. Runner groups are used to collect sets of runners and create a security boundary around them.</p>
<p>When you grant access to a runner group, you can see the runner group listed in the organization's runner settings. Optionally, you can assign additional granular repository access policies to the runner group.</p>
<p>When new runners are created, they are automatically assigned to the default group unless otherwise specified. Runners can only be in one group at a time. You can move runners from one runner group to another. For more information, see <a href="#moving-a-runner-to-a-group">Moving a runner to a group</a>.</p>
<p>For information on how to route jobs to runners in a specific group, see <a href="/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job#choosing-runners-in-a-group">Choosing the runner for a job</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#creating-a-self-hosted-runner-group-for-an-organization">Creating a self-hosted runner group for an organization</a></h2>
<div>
<p>
We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions">Security hardening for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
When creating a runner group, you must choose a policy that defines which repositories have access to the runner group. To change which repositories and workflows can access the runner group, organization owners can set a policy for the organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#disabling-repository-level-self-hosted-runners">Enforcing policies for GitHub Actions in your enterprise</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>All organizations have a single default runner group. Organization owners using the GitHub Team plan can create additional organization-level runner groups.</p>
<p>If no group is specified during the registration process, runners are automatically added to the default group. You can later move the runner from the default group to a custom group. For more information, see <a href="#moving-a-runner-to-a-group">Moving a runner to a group</a>.</p>
<p>For information about how to create a runner group with the REST API, see <a href="/en/rest/actions#self-hosted-runner-groups">REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>

<p>Assign a policy for repository access.</p>
<p>You can configure a runner group to be accessible to a specific list of repositories, or to all repositories in the organization. By default, only private repositories can access runners in a runner group, but you can override this. This setting can't be overridden if configuring an organization's runner group that was shared by an enterprise.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Create group</strong> to create the group and apply the policy.</p>

<h2><a href="#automatically-adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-group">Automatically adding a self-hosted runner to a group</a></h2>
<p>You can use the configuration script to automatically add a new runner to a group. For example, this command registers a new runner and uses the <code>--runnergroup</code> parameter to add it to a group named <code>rg-runnergroup</code>.</p>
<pre><code>./config.sh --url $org_or_enterprise_url --token $token --runnergroup rg-runnergroup
</code></pre>
<p>The command will fail if the runner group doesn't exist:</p>
<pre><code>Could not find any self-hosted runner group named "rg-runnergroup".
</code></pre>
