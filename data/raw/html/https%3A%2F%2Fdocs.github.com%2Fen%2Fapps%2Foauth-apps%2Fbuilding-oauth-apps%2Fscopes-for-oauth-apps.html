Consider building a GitHub App instead of an OAuth app. GitHub Apps use fine-grained permissions instead of scopes, which give you more control over what your app can do. For more information, see <a href="/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps">Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth apps</a> and <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/setting-up-a-github-app/about-creating-github-apps">About creating GitHub Apps</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>When setting up an OAuth app on GitHub, requested scopes are displayed to the user on the authorization form.</p>
<div>
<p>
If you're building a GitHub App, you don’t need to provide scopes in your authorization request. For more on this, see <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps">Authenticating with a GitHub App on behalf of a user</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>If your OAuth app doesn't have access to a browser, such as a CLI tool, then you don't need to specify a scope for users to authenticate to your app. For more information, see <a href="/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow">Authorizing OAuth apps</a>.</p>
<p>Check headers to see what OAuth scopes you have, and what the API action accepts:</p>
<pre><code><span>$ </span><span>curl -H <span>"Authorization: Bearer OAUTH-TOKEN"</span> https://api.github.com/users/codertocat -I</span>
HTTP/2 200
X-OAuth-Scopes: repo, user
X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes: user
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<code>X-OAuth-Scopes</code> lists the scopes your token has authorized.</li>
<li>
<code>X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes</code> lists the scopes that the action checks for.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your OAuth app can request the scopes in the initial redirection. You can specify multiple scopes by separating them with a space using <code>%20</code>:</p>
<pre><code>https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?
  client_id=...&amp;
  scope=user%20repo_deployment
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2><a href="#requested-scopes-and-granted-scopes">Requested scopes and granted scopes</a></h2>
<p>The <code>scope</code> attribute lists scopes attached to the token that were granted by
the user. Normally, these scopes will be identical to what you requested.
However, users can edit their scopes, effectively
granting your application less access than you originally requested. Also, users
can edit token scopes after the OAuth flow is completed.
You should be aware of this possibility and adjust your application's behavior
accordingly.</p>
<p>It's important to handle error cases where a user chooses to grant you
less access than you originally requested. For example, applications can warn
or otherwise communicate with their users that they will see reduced
functionality or be unable to perform some actions.</p>
<p>Also, applications can always send users back through the flow again to get
additional permission, but don’t forget that users can always say no.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="/en/rest/guides/basics-of-authentication">Basics of Authentication guide</a>, which
provides tips on handling modifiable token scopes.</p>
<h2><a href="#normalized-scopes">Normalized scopes</a></h2>
<p>When requesting multiple scopes, the token is saved with a normalized list
of scopes, discarding those that are implicitly included by another requested
scope. For example, requesting <code>user,gist,user:email</code> will result in a
token with <code>user</code> and <code>gist</code> scopes only since the access granted with
<code>user:email</code> scope is included in the <code>user</code> scope.</p>
