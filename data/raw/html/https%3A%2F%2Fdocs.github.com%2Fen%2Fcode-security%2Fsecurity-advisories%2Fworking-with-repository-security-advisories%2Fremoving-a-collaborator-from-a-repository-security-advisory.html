This article applies to editing repository-level advisories as an owner of a public repository.</p>
<p>Users who are not repository owners can contribute to global security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database at <a href="https://github.com/advisories">github.com/advisories</a>. Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database">Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database</a>.</p>

<p>If you remove a user from a repository or organization, and the user is also a collaborator on a security advisory, GitHub will automatically remove the user as a collaborator for the security advisory. This prevents any unauthorized access from ex-collaborators.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the repository name, click <strong>Security</strong>.
