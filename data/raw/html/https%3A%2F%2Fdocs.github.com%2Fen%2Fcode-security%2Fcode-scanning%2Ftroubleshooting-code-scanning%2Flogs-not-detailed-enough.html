<p>If your logs are not detailed enough, there are several steps you can take to make them more useful.</p>
<h2><a href="#enable-step-debug-logging">Enable step debug logging</a></h2>
<p>You can enable step debug logging in GitHub Actions to increase the verbosity of a job's logs during and after a job's execution. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging#enabling-step-debug-logging">Enabling debug logging</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#creating-codeql-debugging-artifacts">Creating CodeQL debugging artifacts</a></h2>
<div>
<p>
CodeQL debugging artifacts contain a copy of the source code being analyzed by CodeQL, therefore we suggest sharing these bundles only with people who are authorized to access that source code.</p>
</div>
<p>You can obtain artifacts to help you debug CodeQL.
The debug artifacts will be uploaded to the workflow run as an artifact named <code>debug-artifacts</code>. The data contains the CodeQL logs, CodeQL database(s), extracted source code files, and any SARIF file(s) produced by the workflow. For more information about downloading CodeQL artifacts, see <a href="/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts">Downloading workflow artifacts</a>.</p>
<p>These artifacts will help you debug problems with CodeQL code scanning. If you contact GitHub support, they might ask for this data.</p>
<h3><a href="#creating-codeql-debugging-artifacts-by-re-running-jobs-with-debug-logging-enabled">Creating CodeQL debugging artifacts by re-running jobs with debug logging enabled</a></h3>
<p>You can create CodeQL debugging artifacts by enabling debug logging and re-running the jobs. For more information about re-running GitHub Actions workflows and jobs, see <a href="/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs">Re-running workflows and jobs</a>.</p>
<p>You need to ensure that you select <strong>Enable debug logging</strong>. This option enables runner diagnostic logging and step debug logging for the run. You'll then be able to download <code>debug-artifacts</code> to investigate further. You do not need to modify the workflow file when creating CodeQL debugging artifacts by re-running jobs.</p>
<h3><a href="#creating-codeql-debugging-artifacts-using-a-workflow-flag">Creating CodeQL debugging artifacts using a workflow flag</a></h3>
<p>You can create CodeQL debugging artifacts by using a flag in your workflow. For this, you need to modify the <code>init</code> step of your CodeQL analysis workflow file and set <code>debug: true</code>.</p>
