<h2><a href="#about-exporting-your-security-overview-data">About exporting your security overview data</a></h2>
<p>From security overview, you can download comma-separated values (CSV) files containing data from several pages of your organization or enterprise's security overview. These files can be used for efforts like security research and in-depth data analysis, and can integrate easily with external datasets.</p>
<p>The overview page contains data about security alerts across your organization or enterprise, while the risk and coverage pages contain data about repositories and how they are affected by security alerts or covered by security features. The CodeQL pull request alerts page contains data about CodeQL alerts that were caught in pull requests merged to the default branch.</p>
<p>The CSV file you download will contain data corresponding to the filters you have applied to security overview. For example, if you add the filter <code>dependabot-alerts:enabled</code>, your file will only contain data for repositories that have enabled Dependabot alerts.</p>
<div>
<p>
In the "Teams" column of the CSV file, each repository will list a maximum of 20 teams with write access to that repository. If more than 20 teams have write access to a repository, the data will be truncated.</p>

The summary views ("Overview", "Coverage" and "Risk") show data only for default alerts. Code scanning alerts from third-party tools, and secret scanning alerts for non-provider patterns or for ignored directories are all omitted from these views. Consequently, files exported from the summary views do not contain data for these types of alert.</p>
