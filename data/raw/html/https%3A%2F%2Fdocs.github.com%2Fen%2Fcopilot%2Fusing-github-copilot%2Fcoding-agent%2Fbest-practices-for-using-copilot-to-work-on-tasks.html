<h2><a href="#making-sure-your-issues-are-well-scoped">Making sure your issues are well-scoped</a></h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot provides better results when assigned clear, well-scoped tasks. An ideal task includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear description of the problem to be solved or the work required.</li>
<li>Complete acceptance criteria on what a good solution looks like (for example, should there be unit tests?).</li>
<li>Directions about which files need to be changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pass a task to Copilot by assigning an issue, it's useful to think of the issue you assign to Copilot as a prompt. Consider whether the issue description is likely to work as an AI prompt, and will enable Copilot to make the required code changes.</p>
<h2><a href="#choosing-the-right-type-of-tasks-to-give-to-copilot">Choosing the right type of tasks to give to Copilot</a></h2>
<p>As you work with Copilot, you'll get a sense of the types of tasks it's best suited to work on. Initially, you might want to start by giving Copilot simpler tasks, to see how it works as a coding agent. For example, you could start by asking Copilot to fix bugs, alter user interface features, improve test coverage, update documentation, improve accessibility, or address technical debt.</p>
<p>Issues that you may choose to work on yourself, rather than assigning to Copilot, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex and broadly scoped tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Broad-scoped, context-rich refactoring problems requiring cross-repository knowledge and testing</li>
<li>Complex issues requiring understanding dependencies and legacy code</li>
<li>Tasks that require deep domain knowledge</li>
<li>Tasks that involve substantial business logic</li>
<li>Large changes to a codebase requiring design consistency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensitive and critical tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Production-critical issues</li>
<li>Tasks involving security, personally identifiable information, authentication repercussions</li>
<li>Incident response</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ambiguous tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks lacking clear definition: tasks with ambiguous requirements, open-ended tasks, tasks that require working through uncertainty to find a solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks where the developer wants to learn to achieve a deeper understanding</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#using-comments-to-iterate-on-a-pull-request">Using comments to iterate on a pull request</a></h2>
<p>Working with Copilot on a pull request is just like working with a human developer: it's common for the pull request to need further work before it can be merged. The process for getting the pull request to a mergeable state is exactly the same when the pull request is created by Copilot as when it's created by a human. If you want, you can work on the feature branch yourself and push changes to the pull request. However, you can also just add comments to the pull request—explaining what you think is incorrect, or could be improved—and leave Copilot to make the required changes.</p>
<p>Copilot will read all comments as soon as they are submitted by users with write access, and will decide whether they require action. It will then start to make any required changes, and will update the pull request when it's done. Because Copilot starts looking at comments as soon as they are submitted, if you are likely to make multiple comments on a pull request it's best to batch them by clicking <strong>Start a review</strong>, rather than clicking <strong>Add single comment</strong>. You can then submit all of your comments at once, triggering Copilot to work on your entire review, rather than working on individual comments separately.</p>
<div>
<p>
Copilot only responds to comments from people who have write access to the repository.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#adding-custom-instructions-to-your-repository">Adding custom instructions to your repository</a></h2>
<p>By adding custom instructions to your repository, you can guide Copilot on how to understand your project and how to build, test and validate its changes.</p>
<p>If Copilot is able to build, test and validate its changes in its own development environment, it is more likely to produce good pull requests which can be merged quickly.</p>
<p>Add instructions to a <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> file in the repository. For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot?tool=webui">Adding repository custom instructions for GitHub Copilot</a>.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an effective <code>copilot-instructions.md</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>This is a Go based repository with a Ruby client for certain API endpoints. It is primarily responsible for ingesting metered usage for GitHub and recording that usage. Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

<span>## Code Standards</span>

<span>### Required Before Each Commit</span>
<span>-</span> Run <span>`make fmt`</span> before committing any changes to ensure proper code formatting
<span>-</span> This will run gofmt on all Go files to maintain consistent style

<span>### Development Flow</span>
<span>-</span> Build: <span>`make build`</span>
<span>-</span> Test: <span>`make test`</span>
<span>-</span> Full CI check: <span>`make ci`</span> (includes build, fmt, lint, test)

<span>## Repository Structure</span>
<span>-</span> <span>`cmd/`</span>: Main service entry points and executables
<span>-</span> <span>`internal/`</span>: Logic related to interactions with other GitHub services
<span>-</span> <span>`lib/`</span>: Core Go packages for billing logic
<span>-</span> <span>`admin/`</span>: Admin interface components
<span>-</span> <span>`config/`</span>: Configuration files and templates
<span>-</span> <span>`docs/`</span>: Documentation
<span>-</span> <span>`proto/`</span>: Protocol buffer definitions. Run <span>`make proto`</span> after making updates here.
<span>-</span> <span>`ruby/`</span>: Ruby implementation components. Updates to this folder should include incrementing this version file using semantic versioning: <span>`ruby/lib/billing-platform/version.rb`</span>
<span>-</span> <span>`testing/`</span>: Test helpers and fixtures

<span>## Key Guidelines</span>
<span>1.</span> Follow Go best practices and idiomatic patterns
<span>2.</span> Maintain existing code structure and organization
<span>3.</span> Use dependency injection patterns where appropriate
<span>4.</span> Write unit tests for new functionality. Use table-driven unit tests when possible.
<span>5.</span> Document public APIs and complex logic. Suggest changes to the <span>`docs/`</span> folder when appropriate

<h2><a href="#using-the-model-context-protocol-mcp">Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a></h2>
<p>You can extend the capabilities of Copilot coding agent by using MCP. This allows Copilot coding agent use tools provided by local MCP servers. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-copilot-coding-agent-with-mcp">Extending Copilot coding agent with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#pre-installing-dependencies-in-github-copilots-environment">Pre-installing dependencies in GitHub Copilot's environment</a></h2>
<p>While working on a task, Copilot has access to its own ephemeral development environment, powered by GitHub Actions, where it can explore your code, make changes, execute automated tests and linters and more.</p>
<p>If Copilot is able to build, test and validate its changes in its own development environment, it is more likely to produce good pull requests which can be merged quickly.</p>
<p>To do that, it will need your project's dependencies. Copilot can discover and install these dependencies itself via a process of trial and error - but this can be slow and unreliable, given the non-deterministic nature of large language models (LLMs).</p>
<p>You can configure a <code>copilot-setup-steps.yml</code> file to pre-install these dependencies before the agent starts working so it can hit the ground running. For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/customizing-the-development-environment-for-copilot-coding-agent#preinstalling-tools-or-dependencies-in-copilots-environment">Customizing the development environment for Copilot coding agent</a>.</p>
