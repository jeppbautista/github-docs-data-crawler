<h2><a href="#about-variables">About variables</a></h2>
<p>Variables provide a way to store and reuse non-sensitive configuration information. You can store any configuration data such as compiler flags, usernames, or server names as variables. Variables are interpolated on the runner machine that runs your workflow. Commands that run in actions or workflow steps can create, read, and modify variables.</p>
<p>You can set your own custom variables or use the default environment variables that GitHub sets automatically. For more information, see <a href="#default-environment-variables">Default environment variables</a>.</p>
<p>You can set a custom variable in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>To define an environment variable for use in a single workflow, you can use the <code>env</code> key in the workflow file. For more information, see <a href="#defining-environment-variables-for-a-single-workflow">Defining environment variables for a single workflow</a>.</li>
<li>To define a configuration variable across multiple workflows, you can define it at the organization, repository, or environment level. For more information, see <a href="#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows">Defining configuration variables for multiple workflows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>
By default, variables render unmasked in your build outputs. If you need greater security for sensitive information, such as passwords, use secrets instead. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/about-secrets">About secrets</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#defining-environment-variables-for-a-single-workflow">Defining environment variables for a single workflow</a></h2>
<p>To set a custom environment variable for a single workflow, you can define it using the <code>env</code> key in the workflow file. The scope of a custom variable set by this method is limited to the element in which it is defined. You can define variables that are scoped for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire workflow, by using <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#env"><code>env</code></a> at the top level of the workflow file.</li>
<li>The contents of a job within a workflow, by using <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idenv"><code>jobs.&lt;job_id&gt;.env</code></a>.</li>
<li>A specific step within a job, by using <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv"><code>jobs.&lt;job_id&gt;.steps[*].env</code></a>.</li>

        <span>env:</span>
          <span>First_Name:</span> <span>Mona</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You can access <code>env</code> variable values using runner environment variables or using contexts. The example above shows three custom variables being used as runner environment variables in an <code>echo</code> command: <code>$DAY_OF_WEEK</code>, <code>$Greeting</code>, and <code>$First_Name</code>. The values for these variables are set, and scoped, at the workflow, job, and step level respectively. The interpolation of these variables happens on the runner.</p>
<p>The commands in the <code>run</code> steps of a workflow, or a referenced action, are processed by the shell you are using on the runner. The instructions in the other parts of a workflow are processed by GitHub Actions and are not sent to the runner. You can use either runner environment variables or contexts in <code>run</code> steps, but in the parts of a workflow that are not sent to the runner you must use contexts to access variable values. For more information, see <a href="#using-contexts-to-access-variable-values">Using contexts to access variable values</a>.</p>
<p>Because runner environment variable interpolation is done after a workflow job is sent to a runner machine, you must use the appropriate syntax for the shell that's used on the runner. In this example, the workflow specifies <code>ubuntu-latest</code>. By default, Linux runners use the bash shell, so you must use the syntax <code>$NAME</code>. By default, Windows runners use PowerShell, so you would use the syntax <code>$env:NAME</code>. For more information about shells, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsshell">Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#naming-conventions-for-environment-variables">Naming conventions for environment variables</a></h3>
<p>When you set an environment variable, you cannot use any of the default environment variable names. For a complete list of default environment variables, see <a href="#default-environment-variables">Default environment variables</a> below. If you attempt to override the value of one of these default variables, the assignment is ignored.</p>
<div>
<p>
You can list the entire set of environment variables that are available to a workflow step by using <span><code>run: env</code></span> in a step and then examining the output for the step.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#defining-configuration-variables-for-multiple-workflows">Defining configuration variables for multiple workflows</a></h2>
<p>You can create configuration variables for use across multiple workflows, and can define them at either the <a href="#creating-configuration-variables-for-an-organization">organization</a>, <a href="#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository">repository</a>, or <a href="#creating-configuration-variables-for-an-environment">environment</a> level.</p>
<p>For example, you can use configuration variables to set default values for parameters passed to build tools at an organization level, but then allow repository owners to override these parameters on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>When you define configuration variables, they are automatically available in the <code>vars</code> context. For more information, see <a href="#using-the-vars-context-to-access-configuration-variable-values">Using the <code>vars</code> context to access configuration variable values</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#configuration-variable-precedence">Configuration variable precedence</a></h3>
<p>If a variable with the same name exists at multiple levels, the variable at the lowest level takes precedence. For example, if an organization-level variable has the same name as a repository-level variable, then the repository-level variable takes precedence. Similarly, if an organization, repository, and environment all have a variable with the same name, the environment-level variable takes precedence.</p>
<p>For reusable workflows, the variables from the caller workflow's repository are used. Variables from the repository that contains the called workflow are not made available to the caller workflow.</p>
<h3><a href="#naming-conventions-for-configuration-variables">Naming conventions for configuration variables</a></h3>
<p>The following rules apply to configuration variable names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can only contain alphanumeric characters (<code>[a-z]</code>, <code>[A-Z]</code>, <code>[0-9]</code>) or underscores (<code>_</code>). Spaces are not allowed.</li>
<li>Must not start with the <code>GITHUB_</code> prefix.</li>
<li>Must not start with a number.</li>
<li>Are case insensitive.</li>
<li>Must be unique to the repository, organization, or enterprise where they are created.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository">Creating configuration variables for a repository</a></h3>
<p>To create secrets or variables on GitHub for a personal account repository, you must be the repository owner. To create secrets or variables on GitHub for an organization repository, you must have <code>admin</code> access. Lastly, to create secrets or variables for a personal account repository or an organization repository through the REST API, you must have collaborator access.</p>

<h3><a href="#limits-for-configuration-variables">Limits for configuration variables</a></h3>
<p>Individual variables are limited to 48 KB in size.</p>
<p>You can store up to 1,000 organization variables, 500 variables per repository, and 100 variables per environment. The total combined size limit for organization and repository variables is 256 KB per workflow run.</p>
<p>A workflow created in a repository can access the following number of variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 500 repository variables, if the total size of repository variables is less than 256 KB. If the total size of repository variables exceeds 256 KB, only the repository variables that fall below the limit will be available (as sorted alphabetically by variable name).</li>
<li>Up to 1,000 organization variables, if the total combined size of repository and organization variables is less than 256 KB. If the total combined size of organization and repository variables exceeds 256 KB, only the organization variables that fall below that limit will be available (after accounting for repository variables and as sorted alphabetically by variable name).</li>
<li>Up to 100 environment-level variables.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>
Environment-level variables do not count toward the 256 KB total size limit. If you exceed the combined size limit for repository and organization variables and still need additional variables, you can use an environment and define additional variables in the environment.</p>

<h2><a href="#using-contexts-to-access-variable-values">Using contexts to access variable values</a></h2>
<p>Contexts are a way to access information about workflow runs, variables, runner environments, jobs, and steps. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts">Accessing contextual information about workflow runs</a>. There are many other contexts that you can use for a variety of purposes in your workflows. For details of where you can use specific contexts within a workflow, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#context-availability">Accessing contextual information about workflow runs</a>.</p>
<p>You can access environment variable values using the <code>env</code> context and configuration variable values using the <code>vars</code> context.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-the-env-context-to-access-environment-variable-values">Using the <code>env</code> context to access environment variable values</a></h3>
<p>In addition to runner environment variables, GitHub Actions allows you to set and read <code>env</code> key values using contexts. Environment variables and contexts are intended for use at different points in the workflow.</p>
<p>The <code>run</code> steps in a workflow, or in a referenced action, are processed by a runner. As a result, you can use runner environment variables here, using the appropriate syntax for the shell you are using on the runner - for example, <code>$NAME</code> for the bash shell on a Linux runner, or <code>$env:NAME</code> for PowerShell on a Windows runner. In most cases you can also use contexts, with the syntax <code>${{ CONTEXT.PROPERTY }}</code>, to access the same value. The difference is that the context will be interpolated and replaced by a string before the job is sent to a runner.</p>
<p>However, you cannot use runner environment variables in parts of a workflow that are processed by GitHub Actions and are not sent to the runner. Instead, you must use contexts. For example, an <code>if</code> conditional, which determines whether a job or step is sent to the runner, is always processed by GitHub Actions. You must therefore use a context in an <code>if</code> conditional statement to access the value of an variable.</p>

        <span>env:</span>
          <span>First_Name:</span> <span>Mona</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this modification of the earlier example, we've introduced an <code>if</code> conditional. The workflow step is now only run if <code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code> is set to "Monday". We access this value from the <code>if</code> conditional statement by using the <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#env-context"><code>env</code> context</a>. The <code>env</code> context is not required for the variables referenced within the <code>run</code> command. They are referenced as runner environment variables and are interpolated after the job is received by the runner. We could, however, have chosen to interpolate those variables before sending the job to the runner, by using contexts. The resulting output would be the same.</p>
<pre><code><span>run:</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"$<span>{{ env.Greeting }}</span> $<span>{{ env.First_Name }}</span>. Today is $<span>{{ env.DAY_OF_WEEK }}</span>!"</span>
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>
Contexts are usually denoted using the dollar sign and curly braces, as <code>${{ context.property }}</code>. In an <code>if</code> conditional, the <code>${{</code> and <code>}}</code> are optional, but if you use them they must enclose the entire comparison statement, as shown above.</p>
</div>
<p>You will commonly use either the <code>env</code> or <code>github</code> context to access variable values in parts of the workflow that are processed before jobs are sent to runners.</p>

When creating workflows and actions, you should always consider whether your code might execute untrusted input from possible attackers. Certain contexts should be treated as untrusted input, as an attacker could insert their own malicious content.

<h2><a href="#default-environment-variables">Default environment variables</a></h2>
<p>The default environment variables that GitHub sets are available to every step in a workflow.</p>
<p>Because default environment variables are set by GitHub and not defined in a workflow, they are not accessible through the <code>env</code> context. However, most of the default variables have a corresponding, and similarly named, context property. For example, the value of the <code>GITHUB_REF</code> variable can be read during workflow processing using the <code>${{ github.ref }}</code> context property.</p>
<p>You can't overwrite the value of the default environment variables named <code>GITHUB_*</code> and <code>RUNNER_*</code>. Currently you can overwrite the value of the <code>CI</code> variable. However, it's not guaranteed that this will always be possible. For more information about setting environment variables, see <a href="#defining-environment-variables-for-a-single-workflow">Defining environment variables for a single workflow</a> and <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable">Workflow commands for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that actions use variables to access the filesystem rather than using hardcoded file paths. GitHub sets variables for actions to use in all runner environments.</p>

<tr>
<td><code>GITHUB_ACTION</code></td>
<td>The name of the action currently running, or the <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsid"><code>id</code></a> of a step. For example, for an action, <code>__repo-owner_name-of-action-repo</code>.<br><br>GitHub removes special characters, and uses the name <code>__run</code> when the current step runs a script without an <code>id</code>. If you use the same script or action more than once in the same job, the name will include a suffix that consists of the sequence number preceded by an underscore. For example, the first script you run will have the name <code>__run</code>, and the second script will be named <code>__run_2</code>.

<div>
<p>
If you need to use a workflow run's URL from within a job, you can combine these variables: <code>$GITHUB_SERVER_URL/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/actions/runs/$GITHUB_RUN_ID</code></p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#detecting-the-operating-system">Detecting the operating system</a></h2>
<p>You can write a single workflow file that can be used for different operating systems by using the <code>RUNNER_OS</code> default environment variable and the corresponding context property <span><code>${{ runner.os }}</code></span>. For example, the following workflow could be run successfully if you changed the operating system from <code>macos-latest</code> to <code>windows-latest</code> without having to alter the syntax of the environment variables, which differs depending on the shell being used by the runner.</p>
<div>
<header><span>YAML</span><pre>on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  if-Windows-else:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - name: condition 1
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        run: echo "The operating system on the runner is $env:RUNNER_OS."
      - name: condition 2
        if: runner.os != 'Windows'
        run: echo "The operating system on the runner is not Windows, it's $RUNNER_OS."
</pre></header><pre><code><span>on:</span> <span>workflow_dispatch</span>

<span>jobs:</span>
  <span>if-Windows-else:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>macos-latest</span>
    <span>steps:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>name:</span> <span>condition</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>if:</span> <span>runner.os</span> <span>==</span> <span>'Windows'</span>
        <span>run:</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"The operating system on the runner is $env:RUNNER_OS."</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>name:</span> <span>condition</span> <span>2</span>
        <span>if:</span> <span>runner.os</span> <span>!=</span> <span>'Windows'</span>
        <span>run:</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"The operating system on the runner is not Windows, it's $RUNNER_OS."</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, the two <code>if</code> statements check the <code>os</code> property of the <code>runner</code> context to determine the operating system of the runner. <code>if</code> conditionals are processed by GitHub Actions, and only steps where the check resolves as <code>true</code> are sent to the runner. Here one of the checks will always be <code>true</code> and the other <code>false</code>, so only one of these steps is sent to the runner. Once the job is sent to the runner, the step is executed and the environment variable in the <code>echo</code> command is interpolated using the appropriate syntax (<code>$env:NAME</code> for PowerShell on Windows, and <code>$NAME</code> for bash and sh on Linux and macOS). In this example, the statement <code>runs-on: macos-latest</code> means that the second step will be run.</p>
<h2><a href="#passing-values-between-steps-and-jobs-in-a-workflow">Passing values between steps and jobs in a workflow</a></h2>
<p>If you generate a value in one step of a job, you can use the value in subsequent steps of the same job by assigning the value to an existing or new environment variable and then writing this to the <code>GITHUB_ENV</code> environment file. The environment file can be used directly by an action, or from a shell command in the workflow file by using the <code>run</code> keyword. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable">Workflow commands for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to pass a value from a step in one job in a workflow to a step in another job in the workflow, you can define the value as a job output. You can then reference this job output from a step in another job.
