You must add a runner to GitHub before you can configure the self-hosted runner application as a service.
For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners">Adding self-hosted runners</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>For Linux systems that use <code>systemd</code>, you can use the <code>svc.sh</code> script that is created after successfully adding the runner to install and manage using the application as a service.</p>
<p>On the runner machine, open a shell in the directory where you installed the self-hosted runner application. Use the commands below to install and manage the self-hosted runner service.</p>

Configuring the self-hosted runner application as a service on Windows is part of the application configuration process. If you have already configured the self-hosted runner application but did not choose to configure it as a service, you must remove the runner from GitHub and re-configure the application. When you re-configure the application, choose the option to configure the application as a service.</p>
