<h2><a href="#about-github-app-modifications">About GitHub App modifications</a></h2>
<p>You can modify your GitHub App registration to change any of the settings that were selected when the app was initially registered. For more information about the settings you can select while registering a GitHub App, see <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/creating-a-github-app">Registering a GitHub App</a>.</p>
<p>For example, you can change the name and description of your app, the permissions granted to your app, the webhooks your app subscribes to, or the visibility of your app.</p>
<p>You can also choose to test new optional features for your GitHub App. See <a href="/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/activating-optional-features-for-github-apps">Activating optional features for GitHub Apps</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#requesting-user-authorization-oauth-during-installation">Requesting user authorization (OAuth) during installation</a></h2>
<p>You can prompt users to authorize your GitHub App when they install it and generate a user access token. When you request user authorization (OAuth) during installation, you must also provide a callback URL where the user will be redirected after they authorize the installation. See <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app">Generating a user access token for a GitHub App</a>.</p>
<ol>

<li>Under "Identifying and authorizing users," select or deselect <strong>Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation</strong>.</li>
<li>Under "Callback URL," enter the full URL to redirect to after a user authorizes the installation.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#enabling-or-disabling-the-device-flow">Enabling or disabling the device flow</a></h2>
<p>You can use the device flow to authorize users for a headless app like a CLI tool or Git credential manager. For more information about using the device flow with GitHub Apps, see <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app#using-the-device-flow-to-generate-a-user-access-token">Generating a user access token for a GitHub App</a>.</p>

<li>Optionally, if you want to redirect users to the setup URL after they update an installation, select <strong>Redirect on update</strong>. An update includes adding or removing a repository for an installation. If "Setup URL" is blank, this will be ignored.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#changing-the-permissions-of-a-github-app">Changing the permissions of a GitHub App</a></h2>
<p>You can change the access permissions that are granted to your GitHub App using the following steps.</p>
<p>When you change the <strong>repository</strong> or <strong>organization</strong> permissions of an app, each account where the app is installed will need to approve the new permissions. When you change the <strong>account</strong> permissions of an app, each user that has authorized the app will need to approve the permission changes. In both cases, GitHub will send an email to each organization owner or user, notifying them of the request to update the app's permissions. Updated permissions won't take effect on an installation or user authorization until the new permissions are approved. You can use the <a href="/en/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads?actionType=new_permissions_accepted#installation">installation webhook</a> to find out when people accept new permissions for your app.</p>
<p>Changing the permissions of an app may also change the webhooks that your app can subscribe to and the actions that your app can take with the API. See <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app">Choosing permissions for a GitHub App</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the settings page for the app you'd like to modify. For more information, see <a href="#navigating-to-your-github-app-settings">Navigating to your GitHub App settings</a> in this article.</li>
<li>In the GitHub Apps settings sidebar, click <strong>Permissions &amp; events</strong>.</li>
<li>Under the sections "Repository permissions," "Organization permissions," and "Account permissions," modify the permissions you'd like to change. For each type of permission, select either "Read-only," "Read and write," or "No access" from the dropdown. See <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/choosing-permissions-for-a-github-app">Choosing permissions for a GitHub App</a>.</li>
<li>Optionally, under "Add a note to users," add a note telling your users why you are changing the permissions that your GitHub App requests.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#activating-or-deactivating-the-github-app-webhook">Activating or deactivating the GitHub App webhook</a></h2>

<h2><a href="#changing-the-webhook-event-subscriptions-of-a-github-app">Changing the webhook event subscriptions of a GitHub App</a></h2>
<p>You can change the webhook events that a GitHub App subscribes to using the following steps.</p>
<p>The specific webhook events that you can select for your GitHub App registration are determined by the type of permissions you selected for your app. You will first need to select the permissions you would like your app to have, and then you can subscribe your app to webhook events that are related to that set of permissions. See <a href="/en/apps/creating-github-apps/creating-github-apps/using-webhooks-with-github-apps">Using webhooks with GitHub Apps</a>.</p>
<ol>
