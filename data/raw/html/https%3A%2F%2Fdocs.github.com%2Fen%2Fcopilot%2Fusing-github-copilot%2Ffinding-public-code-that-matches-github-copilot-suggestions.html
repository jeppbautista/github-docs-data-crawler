<h2><a href="#limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p>References to matching code are currently available in JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and on the GitHub website.</p>
<h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>References to matching code are only generated if Copilot is configured to allow suggestions that match publicly available code. This is configured in either your personal or  organization settings. For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-your-personal-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-suggestions-matching-public-code">Managing Copilot policies as an individual subscriber</a> or  <a href="/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization#policies-for-suggestion-matching">Managing policies for Copilot in your organization</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>If you've allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details of the code that a suggestion matches. This happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you accept a code completion suggestion in the editor.</li>
<li>When a response in Copilot Chat includes matching code.</li>

<h3><a href="#code-referencing-for-copilot-code-completion">Code referencing for Copilot code completion</a></h3>
<p>When you accept a code completion suggestion that matches code in a public GitHub repository, information about the matching code is logged. The log entry includes the URLs of files containing matching code, and the name of the license that applies to that code, if any was found. This allows you to review these references and decide how to proceed. For example, you can decide what attribution to use, or whether you want to remove this code from your project.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Code referencing for code completion only occurs for matches of accepted Copilot suggestions. Code you have written, and Copilot suggestions you have altered, are not checked for matches to public code.</li>
<li>Typically, matches to public code occur in less than one percent of Copilot suggestions, so you should not expect to see code references for many suggestions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a href="#code-referencing-for-copilot-chat">Code referencing for Copilot Chat</a></h3>

</div>
<h3><a href="#how-code-referencing-finds-matching-code">How code referencing finds matching code</a></h3>
<p>Copilot code referencing searches for matches by taking the code suggestion, plus some of the code that will surround the suggestion if it is accepted, and comparing it against an index of all public repositories on GitHub.com. Code in private GitHub repositories, or code outside of GitHub, is not included in the search process. The search index is refreshed every few months. As a result, newly committed code, and code from public repositories deleted before the index was created, may not be included in the search. For the same reason, the search may return matches to code that has been deleted or moved since the index was created.</p>
