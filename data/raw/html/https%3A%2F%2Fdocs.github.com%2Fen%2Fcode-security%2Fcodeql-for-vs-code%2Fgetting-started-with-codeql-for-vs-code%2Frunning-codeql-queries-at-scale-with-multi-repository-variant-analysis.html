<h2><a href="#about-running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-multi-repository-variant-analysis">About running CodeQL queries at scale with multi-repository variant analysis</a></h2>
<p>With multi-repository variant analysis (MRVA), you can run CodeQL queries on a list of up to 1,000 repositories on GitHub from Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>When you run MRVA against a list of repositories, your query is run against each repository that has a CodeQL database available to analyze. GitHub creates and stores the latest CodeQL database for the default branch of thousands of public repositories, including every repository that runs code scanning using CodeQL.</p>
<p>You need to enable code scanning using CodeQL on GitHub, using either default setup or advanced setup, before adding your repository to a list for analysis. For information about enabling code scanning using CodeQL, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically">Configuring default setup for code scanning</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#how-mrva-runs-queries-against-codeql-databases-on-githubcom">How MRVA runs queries against CodeQL databases on GitHub.com</a></h3>
<p>When you run MRVA, the analysis is run entirely using GitHub Actions. You don't need to create any workflows, but you must specify which repository the CodeQL for Visual Studio Code extension should use as a controller repository. As the analysis of each repository completes, the results are sent to VS Code for you to view.</p>
<p>The CodeQL extension builds a CodeQL pack with your library and any library dependencies. The CodeQL pack and your selected repository list are posted to an API endpoint on GitHub, which triggers a GitHub Actions dynamic workflow in your controller repository. The workflow spins up multiple parallel jobs to execute the CodeQL query against the repositories in the list, optimizing query execution. As each repository is analyzed, the results are processed and displayed in VS Code.</p>
<h3><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You must define a controller repository before you can run your first multi-repository variant analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controller repositories can be empty, but they must have at least one commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On GitHub.com, the controller repository visibility can be "public" if you plan to analyze only public repositories. The variant analysis will be free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The controller repository visibility must be "private" if you need to analyze any private or internal repositories on GitHub.com.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any actions minutes that you use to run variant analysis on private or internal repositories, above the free limit, is charged to the repository owner. For more information about free minutes and billing, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">About billing for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>

<p>
CodeQL analysis always requires a CodeQL database to run queries against. When you run variant analysis against a list of repositories, your query will only be executed against the repositories that currently have a CodeQL database available to download. The best way to make a repository available for variant analysis is to enable code scanning with CodeQL. For information about enabling code scanning using CodeQL, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically">Configuring default setup for code scanning</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Type a name for the new list and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select your list in the view, then click <strong>+</strong> to add a repository to your list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="#managing-your-custom-lists-of-repositories">Managing your custom lists of repositories</a></h3>
<p>You can manage and edit your custom lists by right-clicking on either the list name, or a repository name within the list, and selecting an option from the context menu.</p>
<p>The custom lists are stored in your workspace in a <code>databases.json</code> file. If you want to edit this file directly in Visual Studio Code, you can open it by clicking <strong>{ }</strong> in the view header.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to continue analyzing a set of repositories that had results for your query, click <strong>Copy repository list</strong> in the "Variant Analysis Results" view to add a list of only the repositories that have results to the clipboard as JSON.</p>
<p>In the following example snippet, <code>my-organization/my-repository</code> had results for a query:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
    <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"new-repo-list"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"repositories"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>"my-organization/my-repository"</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can then insert the <code>new-repo-list</code> of repositories into <code>databases.json</code>for easy access in the "Variant Analysis Repositories" view.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-github-code-search-to-add-repositories-to-a-custom-list">Using GitHub code search to add repositories to a custom list</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
This feature uses the legacy code search via the GitHub code search API. For more information on the syntax to use, see <a href="/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code">Searching code (legacy)</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can use code search directly in the CodeQL extension to add a subset of repositories from GitHub to a custom list.</p>
<p>For example, to add all repositories in the <code>rails</code> organization on GitHub, search <code>org:rails</code>.</p>
<p>You can add a maximum of 1,000 repositories to a custom list per search.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the "Variant Analysis Repositories" view, choose the list that you want to add repositories to. You can create a new list or choose an existing list that already contains repositories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click on the list you have chosen and then click <strong>Add repositories with GitHub code search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the pop-up that appears at the top of the application, under the search bar, select a language for your search from the choices in the dropdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the search bar, type the search query that you want to use and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view the progress of your search in the bottom right corner of the application in a box with the text <code>Searching for repositories...</code>. If you click <strong>Cancel</strong>, no repositories will be added to your list. Once complete, you will see the resulting repositories appear in the dropdown under your custom list in the Variant Analysis Repositories view.</p>
<p>Some of the resulting repositories will not have CodeQL databases and some may not allow access by the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code. When you run an analysis on the list, the "Variant Analysis Results" view will show you which repositories were analyzed, which denied access, and which had no CodeQL database.</p>
<h2><a href="#running-codeql-queries-with-multi-repository-variant-analysis-on-self-hosted-runners">Running CodeQL queries with multi-repository variant analysis on self-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>To run CodeQL queries with multi-repository variant analysis on self-hosted runners, you first need to ensure that you have added a self-hosted runner to your controller repository, or ensure that the controller repository has access to an organization- or enterprise-level runner.</p>
<p>You then need to add a new Actions repository variable in your controller repository with the name <code>MRVA_RUNNER_OS</code> containing a JSON-formatted list of the labels of the self-hosted runner you wish to use. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>"self-hosted"</span><span>,</span> <span>"macOS"</span><span>,</span> <span>"ARM64"</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>
You must set the <code>MRVA_RUNNER_OS</code> variable under the Actions repository variables in your controller repository's settings, and not an environment variable or Actions secret under your Actions settings or in your workflow's <code>.yml</code> file.
See <a href="/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#creating-configuration-variables-for-a-repository">Store information in variables</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-repository">Adding self-hosted runners</a> and <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/managing-access-to-self-hosted-runners-using-groups#changing-which-repositories-can-access-a-runner-group">Managing access to self-hosted runners using groups</a>.</p>
<p>When you run a query with multi-repository variant analysis on a self-hosted runner, the analysis is run entirely on the self-hosted runner. You don't need to create any new workflows, but you must specify which repository the CodeQL for Visual Studio Code extension should use as a controller repository. As the analysis of each repository completes, the results are sent to VS Code for you to view.</p>
