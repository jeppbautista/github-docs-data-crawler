<p>You can use GitHub Actions to automate your project management tasks by creating workflows. Each workflow contains a series of tasks that are performed automatically every time the workflow runs. For example, you can create a workflow that runs every time an issue is created to add a label and leave a comment.</p>
<h2><a href="#when-do-workflows-run">When do workflows run?</a></h2>
<p>You can configure your workflows to run on a schedule or be triggered when an event occurs. For example, you can set your workflow to run when someone creates an issue in a repository.</p>
<p>Many workflow triggers are useful for automating project management.</p>
<ul>
<li>An issue is opened, assigned, or labeled.</li>
<li>A comment is added to an issue.</li>
<li>A scheduled time.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a full list of events that can trigger workflows, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows">Events that trigger workflows</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#what-can-workflows-do">What can workflows do?</a></h2>
<p>Workflows can do many things, such as commenting on an issue, adding or removing labels, and opening issues.</p>
<p>You can learn about using GitHub Actions for project management by following these tutorials, which include example workflows that you can adapt to meet your needs.</p>
