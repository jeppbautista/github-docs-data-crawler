<h2><a href="#about-the-dependency-graph-and-sbom-exports">About the dependency graph and SBOM exports</a></h2>
<p>The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository and any dependencies that are submitted for the repository using the dependency submission API. For each repository, it shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependencies, the ecosystems and packages it depends on</li>
<li>Dependents, the repositories and packages that depend on it</li>
</ul>
<p>For each dependency, you can see the version, license information, the manifest file which included it, and whether it has known vulnerabilities. For package ecosystems supporting transitive dependencies, the relationship status will be displayed and you can click "</p>
<p>You can also search for a specific dependency using the search bar. Dependencies are sorted automatically with vulnerable packages at the top.</p>
<p>You can export the current state of the dependency graph for your repository as a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) using the industry standard <a href="https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/">SPDX</a> format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Via the GitHub UI</li>
<li>Using the REST API</li>
</ul>
<p>An SBOM is a formal, machine-readable inventory of a project's dependencies and associated information (such as versions, package identifiers, licenses, transitive paths for package ecosystems with support for transitive dependency labeling, and copyright information). SBOMs help reduce supply chain risks by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing transparency about the dependencies used by your repository</li>
<li>Allowing vulnerabilities to be identified across your codebase</li>
<li>Providing insights in the license compliance, security, or quality issues that may exist in your codebase</li>
<li>Enabling you to better comply with various data protection standards</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about the ecosystems supporting transitive dependency labeling, see <a href="/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/dependency-graph-supported-package-ecosystems">Dependency graph supported package ecosystems</a>.</p>
<p>If your company provides software to the US federal government per <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028">Executive Order 14028</a>, you will need to provide an SBOM for your product. You can also use SBOMs as part of your audit process and use them to comply with regulatory and legal requirements.</p>

Dependents are not included in SBOMs.</p>
