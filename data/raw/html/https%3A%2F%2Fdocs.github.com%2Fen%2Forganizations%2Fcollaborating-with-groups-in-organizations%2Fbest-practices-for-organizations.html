<h2><a href="#assign-multiple-owners">Assign multiple owners</a></h2>
<p>If an organization only has one owner, the organization's projects can become inaccessible if the owner is unreachable. To ensure that no one will lose access to a project, we recommend that at least two people within each organization have the owner role. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization">Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-teams">Use teams</a></h2>
<p>We recommend using teams to facilitate collaboration in your organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams">About teams</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend keeping teams visible whenever possible and reserving secret teams for sensitive situations. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/changing-team-visibility">Changing team visibility</a>.</p>
