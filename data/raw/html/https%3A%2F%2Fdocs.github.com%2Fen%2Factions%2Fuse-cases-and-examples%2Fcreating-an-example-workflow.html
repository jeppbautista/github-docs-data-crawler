<h2><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This guide shows you how to create a basic workflow that is triggered when code is pushed to your repository.</p>
<p>To get started with preconfigured workflows, browse through the list of templates in the <a href="https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows">actions/starter-workflows</a> repository. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/writing-workflows/using-starter-workflows">Using workflow templates</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#creating-an-example-workflow">Creating an example workflow</a></h2>
<p>GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax to define the workflow. Each workflow is stored as a separate YAML file in your code repository, in a directory named <code>.github/workflows</code>.</p>
<p>You can create an example workflow in your repository that automatically triggers a series of commands whenever code is pushed. In this workflow, GitHub Actions checks out the pushed code, installs the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bats">bats</a> testing framework, and runs a basic command to output the bats version: <code>bats -v</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In your repository, create the <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory to store your workflow files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory, create a new file called <code>learn-github-actions.yml</code> and add the following code.</p>
<div>

<p>Commit these changes and push them to your GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Your new GitHub Actions workflow file is now installed in your repository and will run automatically each time someone pushes a change to the repository. To see the details about a workflow's execution history, see <a href="#viewing-the-activity-for-a-workflow-run">Viewing the activity for a workflow run</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#understanding-the-workflow-file">Understanding the workflow file</a></h2>
<p>To help you understand how YAML syntax is used to create a workflow file, this section explains each line of the introduction's example:</p>

name: learn-github-actions

# Optional - The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow, which will appear in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab. This example uses an expression with the `github` context to display the username of the actor that triggered the workflow run. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#run-name).
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions

# Specifies the trigger for this workflow. This example uses the `push` event, so a workflow run is triggered every time someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request. This is triggered by a push to every branch; for examples of syntax that runs only on pushes to specific branches, paths, or tags, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore).

# Configures the job to run on the latest version of an Ubuntu Linux runner. This means that the job will execute on a fresh virtual machine hosted by GitHub. For syntax examples using other runners, see [AUTOTITLE](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on)

# The `uses` keyword specifies that this step will run `v4` of the `actions/checkout` action. This is an action that checks out your repository onto the runner, allowing you to run scripts or other actions against your code (such as build and test tools). You should use the checkout action any time your workflow will use the repository's code.
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

# This step uses the `actions/setup-node@v4` action to install the specified version of the Node.js. (This example uses version 20.) This puts both the `node` and `npm` commands in your `PATH`.
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

# The `run` keyword tells the job to execute a command on the runner. In this case, you are using `npm` to install the `bats` software testing package.
      - run: npm install -g bats

# Finally, you'll run the `bats` command with a parameter that outputs the software version.

<p>In this diagram, you can see the workflow file you just created and how the GitHub Actions components are organized in a hierarchy. Each step executes a single action or shell script. Steps 1 and 2 run actions, while steps 3 and 4 run shell scripts.
