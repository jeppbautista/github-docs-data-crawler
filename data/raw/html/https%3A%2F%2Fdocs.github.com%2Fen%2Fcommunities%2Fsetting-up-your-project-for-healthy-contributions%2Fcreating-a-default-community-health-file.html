<h2><a href="#about-default-community-health-files">About default community health files</a></h2>
<p>Default community health files are a set of predefined files that provide guidance and templates for maintaining a healthy and collaborative open source project. These files help you automate and standardize various aspects of your project's development and community interaction, promoting transparency, good practices, and collaboration.</p>
<p>You can add default community health files to a public repository called <code>.github</code> and GitHub will use and display default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>.github</code> folder</li>
<li>The root of the repository</li>
<li>The <code>docs</code> folder</li>
</ul>
<p>If no corresponding file is found in the current repository, GitHub will use the default file from the <code>.github</code> repository, following the same order of precedence.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>.github</code> repository must be <strong>public</strong> for templates to be applied organization-wide. Private <code>.github</code> repositories are not supported.</p>
<p>For example, anyone who creates an issue or pull request in a repository that does not have its own <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file will see a link to the default <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> from the <code>.github</code> repository. However, if a repository has any files in its own <code>.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</code> folder, such as issue templates or a <code>_config.yml</code> file, none of the contents of the default <code>.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE</code> folder will be used. This allows repository maintainers to override the default files with specific templates or content on per-repository basis.</p>
<p>Storing the files in <code>.github</code> repository allows making changes to the defaults just in one place. Additionally, they wonâ€™t appear in the file browser or Git history of the individual repositories, and are not included in their clones, packages, or downloads.</p>
<p>As a repository maintainer, you can use the community standards checklist to see if your project meets the recommended community standards to help people use and contribute to your project. For more information, see <a href="/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories">About community profiles for public repositories</a>.</p>
