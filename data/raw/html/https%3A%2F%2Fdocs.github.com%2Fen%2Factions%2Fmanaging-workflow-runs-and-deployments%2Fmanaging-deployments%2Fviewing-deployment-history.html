<h2><a href="#about-deployment-history">About deployment history</a></h2>
<p>You can deliver deployments through GitHub Actions and environments or with the REST API and third party apps. For more information about using environments to deploy with GitHub Actions, see <a href="/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/managing-environments-for-deployment">Managing environments for deployment</a>. For more information about deployments with the REST API, see <a href="/en/rest/repos#deployments">REST API endpoints for repositories</a>.</p>
<p>On the deployments page of your repository, you can view the following aspects of your deployments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently active deployments across various environments</li>
<li>Deployments filtered by environment</li>
<li>Your repository's full deployment history</li>
<li>Associated commits that triggered the deployment</li>
<li>Connected GitHub Actions workflow logs</li>
<li>The deployment URL (if one exists)</li>
<li>The source pull request and branch related to each deployment</li>
<li>Deployment statuses. For more information about deployment statuses, see <a href="/en/rest/deployments/deployments#about-deployments">REST API endpoints for deployments</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the deployments page shows currently active deployments from select environments and a timeline of the latest deployments for all environments.</p>
