<p>If you're the only member with <em>owner</em> privileges, give another organization member the owner role. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/maintaining-ownership-continuity-for-your-organization#appointing-an-organization-owner">Maintaining ownership continuity for your organization</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact the new owner and make sure they are able to <a href="/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/accessing-your-organizations-settings">access the organization's settings</a>.</p>

<p>If you are currently responsible for paying for GitHub in your organization, you'll also need to have the new owner or a <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization">billing manager</a> update the organization's payment information. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-your-billing/managing-your-payment-and-billing-information">Managing your payment and billing information</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
Removing yourself from the organization <strong>does not</strong> update the billing information on file for the organization account. The new owner or a billing manager must update the billing information on file to remove your credit card or PayPal information.</p>
