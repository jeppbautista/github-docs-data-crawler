<p>This guide will walk you through setting up, configuring and managing your GitHub Team account as an organization owner.</p>
<h2><a href="#part-1-configuring-your-account-on-githubcom">Part 1: Configuring your account on GitHub.com</a></h2>
<p>As the first steps in starting with GitHub Team, you will need to create a personal account or log into your existing account on GitHub, create an organization, and set up billing.</p>
<h3><a href="#1-about-organizations">1. About organizations</a></h3>
<p>Organizations are shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once. Owners and administrators can manage member access to the organization's data and projects with sophisticated security and administrative features. For more information on the features of organizations, see <a href="/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations#terms-of-service-and-data-protection-for-organizations">About organizations</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#2-creating-an-organization-and-signing-up-for-github-team">2. Creating an organization and signing up for GitHub Team</a></h3>
<p>Before creating an organization, you will need to create a personal account or log in to your existing account on GitHub.com. For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github">Creating an account on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Once your personal account is set up, you can create an organization and pick a plan. This is where you can choose a GitHub Team subscription for your organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch">Creating a new organization from scratch</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#3-managing-billing-for-an-organization">3. Managing billing for an organization</a></h3>
<p>You must manage billing settings, payment method, and paid features and products for each of your personal accounts and organizations separately. You can switch between settings for your different accounts using the context switcher in your settings. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-your-billing/about-billing-on-github#switching-between-settings-for-your-different-accounts">About billing on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Your organization's billing settings page allows you to manage settings like your payment method, billing cycle and billing email, or view information such as your subscription, billing date and payment history. You can also view and upgrade your storage and GitHub Actions minutes. For more information on managing your billing settings, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-your-billing">Managing your billing</a>.</p>
<p>Only organization members with the <em>owner</em> or <em>billing manager</em> role can access or change billing settings for your organization. A billing manager is someone who manages the billing settings for your organization and does not use a paid license in your organization's subscription. For more information on adding a billing manager to your organization, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization">Adding a billing manager to your organization</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#part-2-adding-members-and-setting-up-teams">Part 2: Adding members and setting up teams</a></h2>
<p>After creating your organization, you can invite members and set permissions and roles. You can also create different levels of teams and set customized levels of permissions for your organization's repositories, projects, and apps.</p>
<h3><a href="#1-managing-members-of-your-organization">1. Managing members of your organization</a></h3>
<p>You can invite anyone to be a member of your organization, as long as they have a personal account on GitHub. You can also remove members and reinstate former members. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-membership-in-your-organization">Managing membership in your organization</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#2-organization-permissions-and-roles">2. Organization permissions and roles</a></h3>
<p>Each person in your organization has a role that defines their level of access to the organization. The member role is the default, and you can assign owner and billing manager roles as well as "team maintainer" permissions. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization">Roles in an organization</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#3-about-and-creating-teams">3. About and creating teams</a></h3>
<p>Teams are groups of organization members that you can create to reflect your company or group's structure with cascading access permissions and mentions. Organization members can send notifications to a team or request reviews, and teams can be visible or secret. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams">About teams</a>.</p>
<p>You can create independent teams or have multiple levels of nested teams to reflect your group or company's hierarchy. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team">Creating a team</a>.</p>

For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/repository-roles-for-an-organization">Repository roles for an organization</a>.</p>
<p>You can also customize access to your organization's projects and allow individual organization members to manage your organization's GitHub Apps. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects">Managing access to your projects</a>, <a href="/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-project-boards">Managing access to your organizationâ€™s projects (classic)</a>, and <a href="/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization">Managing programmatic access to your organization</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#part-3-managing-security-for-your-organization">Part 3: Managing security for your organization</a></h2>

<h3><a href="#3-reviewing-your-organizations-audit-log-and-integrations">3. Reviewing your organization's audit log and integrations</a></h3>
<p>The audit log for your organization allows you, as an organization owner, to review the actions performed by members of the organization within the last 180 days. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/reviewing-the-audit-log-for-your-organization">Reviewing the audit log for your organization</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="#1-managing-organization-policies">1. Managing organization policies</a></h3>
<p>You can manage permissions and policies for a number of different actions and features in your organization.</p>
<p>For example, to protect your organization's data, you can restrict repository creation in your organization.

<h3><a href="#3-using-organization-level-community-health-files-and-moderation-tools">3. Using organization-level community health files and moderation tools</a></h3>
<p>You can create default community health files, such as a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file, or even issue and pull request templates, for your organization.
