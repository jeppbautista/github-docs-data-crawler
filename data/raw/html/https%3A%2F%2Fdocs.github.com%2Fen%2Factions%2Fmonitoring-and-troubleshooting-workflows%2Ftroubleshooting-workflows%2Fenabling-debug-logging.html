<p>These extra logs are enabled by setting secrets or variables in the repository containing the workflow, so the same permissions requirements will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create secrets or variables on GitHub for a personal account repository, you must be the repository owner. To create secrets or variables on GitHub for an organization repository, you must have <code>admin</code> access. Lastly, to create secrets or variables for a personal account repository or an organization repository through the REST API, you must have collaborator access.</li>
<li>To create secrets or variables for an environment in a personal account repository, you must be the repository owner. To create secrets or variables for an environment in an organization repository, you must have <code>admin</code> access. For more information on environments, see <a href="/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/managing-environments-for-deployment">Managing environments for deployment</a>.</li>
<li>Organization owners can create secrets or variables at the organization level.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on setting secrets and variables, see <a href="/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions">Using secrets in GitHub Actions</a> and <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables">Store information in variables</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, anyone who has access to run a workflow can enable runner diagnostic logging and step debug logging for a workflow re-run. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs">Re-running workflows and jobs</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#enabling-runner-diagnostic-logging">Enabling runner diagnostic logging</a></h2>
<p>Runner diagnostic logging provides additional log files that contain information about how a runner is executing a job. Two extra log files are added to the log archive:</p>
<ul>
<li>The runner process log, which includes information about coordinating and setting up runners to execute jobs.</li>
<li>The worker process log, which logs the execution of a job.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>To enable runner diagnostic logging, set the following secret or variable in the repository that contains the workflow: <code>ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG</code> to <code>true</code>. If both the secret and variable are set, the value of the secret takes precedence over the variable.</li>
<li>To download runner diagnostic logs, download the log archive of the workflow run. The runner diagnostic logs are contained in the <code>runner-diagnostic-logs</code> folder. For more information on downloading logs, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs#downloading-logs">Using workflow run logs</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#enabling-step-debug-logging">Enabling step debug logging</a></h2>
<p>Step debug logging increases the verbosity of a job's logs during and after a job's execution.</p>
<ol>
<li>To enable step debug logging, set the following secret or variable in the repository that contains the workflow: <code>ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG</code> to <code>true</code>. If both the secret and variable are set, the value of the secret takes precedence over the variable.</li>
<li>After setting the secret or variable, more debug events are shown in the step logs. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs#viewing-logs-to-diagnose-failures">Using workflow run logs</a>.</li>
