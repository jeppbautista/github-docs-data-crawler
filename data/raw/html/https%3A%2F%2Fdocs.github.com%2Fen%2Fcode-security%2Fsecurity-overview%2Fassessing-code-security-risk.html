<p>You can use the different views on your <strong>Security</strong> tab to explore the security risks in your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Overview:</strong> use to explore trends in <strong>Detection</strong>, <strong>Remediation</strong>, and <strong>Prevention</strong> of security alerts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Risk:</strong> use to explore the current state of repositories, across all alert types.</li>
<li>
<strong>Assessments:</strong> use to explore the current state of repositories, for secret leaks specifically</li>
<li>
<strong>Alerts views:</strong> use to explore code scanning, Dependabot, or secret scanning alerts in greater detail.</li>
</ul>
<p>These views provide you with the data and filters to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess the landscape of security risk of code stored in all your repositories.</li>
<li>Identify the highest impact vulnerabilities to address.</li>
<li>Monitor your progress in remediating potential vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Understand how your organization is affected by secret leaks and exposures.</li>
<li>Export your current selection of data for further analysis and reporting.</li>
</ul>
