<h2><a href="#about-fine-grained-personal-access-token-requests">About fine-grained personal access token requests</a></h2>
<p>When organization members create a fine-grained personal access token to access resources owned by the organization, if the organization requires approval for fine-grained personal access tokens, then an organization owner must approve the token before it can be used to access any resources that are not public. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization">Setting a personal access token policy for your organization</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub will notify organization owners with a daily email about all fine-grained personal access tokens that are awaiting approval. When a token is denied or approved, the user who created the token will receive an email notification.</p>
<div>
<p>
Only fine-grained personal access tokens, not personal access tokens (classic), are subject to approval. Unless the organization has restricted access by personal access tokens (classic), any personal access token (classic) can access organization resources without prior approval. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/setting-a-personal-access-token-policy-for-your-organization">Setting a personal access token policy for your organization</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Organization owners can also use the REST API to review and manage fine-grained personal access token requests. These endpoints can only be called by GitHub Apps, and cannot be called with personal access tokens or OAuth apps. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/orgs/orgs#list-requests-to-access-organization-resources-with-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens">REST API endpoints for organizations</a>.</p>
