<h2><a href="#about-editing-your-configuration-of-default-setup">About editing your configuration of default setup</a></h2>
<p>After running an initial analysis of your code with default setup, you may need to make changes to your configuration to better meet your needs. For existing configurations of default setup, you can edit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which languages default setup will analyze.</li>
<li>The query suite run during analysis. For more information on the available query suites, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/codeql-query-suites">CodeQL query suites</a>.</li>
<li>The threat models (public preview) to use for analysis. Your choice of threat model determines which sources of tainted data are treated as a risk to your application. During the public preview, threat models are supported only for analysis of Java/Kotlin and C#. For more information about threat models, see <a href="#including-local-sources-of-tainted-data-in-default-setup">Including local sources of tainted data in default setup</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your codebase depends on a library or framework that is not recognized by the standard libraries included with CodeQL, you can also extend the CodeQL coverage in default setup using CodeQL model packs. For more information, see <a href="#extending-codeql-coverage-with-codeql-model-packs-in-default-setup">Extending CodeQL coverage with CodeQL model packs in default setup</a>.</p>
<p>If you need to change any other aspects of your code scanning configuration, consider configuring advanced setup. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/configuring-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning">Configuring advanced setup for code scanning</a>.</p>

<p>
Threat models are currently in public preview and subject to change. During the public preview, threat models are supported only by analysis for Java/Kotlin and C#.</p>
</div>
<p>If your codebase only considers remote network requests to be potential sources of tainted data, then we recommend using the default threat model. If your codebase considers sources other than network requests to potentially contain tainted data, then you can use threat models to add these additional sources to your CodeQL analysis. During the public preview, you can add local sources (for example: command-line arguments, environment variables, file systems, and databases) that your codebase may consider to be additional sources of tainted data.</p>
<p>You can edit the threat model used in a default setup configuration. For more information, see <a href="#customizing-your-existing-configuration-of-default-setup">Customizing your existing configuration of default setup</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>
CodeQL model packs are currently in public preview and subject to change. Model packs are supported for  C/C++, C#, Java/Kotlin, Python, and Ruby analysis.</p>
<p>The CodeQL model editor in the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code supports modeling dependencies for  C#, Java/Kotlin, Python, and Ruby.</p>
</div>
<p>If you use frameworks and libraries that are not recognized by the standard libraries included with CodeQL, you can model your dependencies and extend code scanning analysis. For more information, see <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/supported-languages-and-frameworks/">Supported languages and frameworks</a> in the documentation for CodeQL.</p>
<p>For default setup, you need to define the models of your additional dependencies in CodeQL model packs. You can extend coverage in default setup with CodeQL model packs for individual repositories, or at scale for all repositories in an organization.</p>
<p>For more information about CodeQL model packs and writing your own, see <a href="/en/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-for-vs-code-extension/using-the-codeql-model-editor">Using the CodeQL model editor</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the <code>.github/codeql/extensions</code> directory of the repository, copy the model pack directory which should include a <code>codeql-pack.yml</code> file and any <code>.yml</code> files containing additional models for the libraries or frameworks you wish to include in your analysis.</li>
<li>The model packs will be automatically detected and used in your code scanning analysis.</li>
<li>If you later change your configuration to use advanced setup, any model packs in the <code>.github/codeql/extensions</code> directory will still be recognized and used.</li>
</ol>

If you extend coverage with CodeQL model packs for all repositories in an organization, the model packs that you specify must be published to the GitHub Container registry and be accessible to the repositories that run code scanning.
