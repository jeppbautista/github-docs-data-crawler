<p>You can use security overview to see which repositories and teams have already enabled each security feature, and where people need more encouragement to adopt these features. The "Security coverage" view shows a summary and detailed information on feature enablement for an organization. You can filter the view to show a subset of repositories using the "enabled" and "not enabled" links, the "Teams" dropdown menu, and a search field in the page header.</p>

<div>
<p> "Pull request alerts" are reported as enabled only when code scanning has analyzed at least one pull request since alerts were enabled for the repository.</p>
</div>
<p>You can download a CSV file of the data displayed on the "Security coverage" page. This data file can be used for efforts like security research and in-depth data analysis, and can integrate easily with external datasets. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-overview/exporting-data-from-security-overview">Exporting data from security overview</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the "Enablement trends" view to see enablement status and enablement status trends over time for Dependabot, code scanning, or secret scanning for repositories in an organization, or across organizations in an enterprise. For each of these features, you can view a graph visualizing the percentage of repositories that have the feature enabled, as well as a detailed table with enablement percentages for different points in time.

<h2><a href="#interpreting-and-acting-on-the-enablement-data">Interpreting and acting on the enablement data</a></h2>
<p>Some security features can and should be enabled on all repositories. For example, secret scanning alerts and push protection reduce the risk of a security leak no matter what information is stored in the repository. If you see repositories that don't already use these features, you should either enable them or discuss an enablement plan with the team who owns the repository. For information on enabling features for a whole organization, see <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization">Enabling security features in your organization</a>.</p>
<p>Other features are not suitable for use in all repositories. For example, there would be no point in enabling Dependabot for repositories that only use ecosystems or languages that are unsupported. As such, it's normal to have some repositories where these features are not enabled.</p>
<p>Your enterprise may also have configured policies to limit the use of some security features. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-code-security-and-analysis-for-your-enterprise">Enforcing policies for code security and analysis for your enterprise</a>.</p>
