<h2><a href="#about-ai-agents-on-github">About AI agents on GitHub</a></h2>
<p>Developers in your enterprise may be used to using AI as a pair programming tool. In this model, developers work with AI assistants synchronously and receive code suggestions during the development phase of a project.</p>
<p>AI agents are more like peer programmers. Agents can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform asynchronous tasks, such as running tests or fixing issues in your backlog, with less need for human intervention.</li>
<li>Contribute to workflows beyond the development phase, such as ideation or optimization after a release.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collaborating with agents can give your employees more time to focus on other priorities, such as high-level planning, and bring the benefits of AI to non-developer roles by giving more power to natural language prompts.</p>
<p>GitHub Copilot's agentic AI features are integrated into GitHub's cohesive platform, providing a more streamlined user experience and simplified licensing and governance controls compared to adopting a range of third-party tools.</p>
<h2><a href="#example-scenario">Example scenario</a></h2>
<p>You're an engineering manager at Mona's, a boutique umbrella retailer. Your team has been tasked with adding an <strong>AI-powered widget</strong> to the company's online store. The widget will help customers to choose the right umbrella by making tailored recommendations based on factors like the user's location and local weather trends.</p>
<p>To hit a tight deadline, you're aiming to speed up each stage of the process, for both developers and non-developers in your team. You also want to make sure the team is not overwhelmed with maintenance tasks once the new feature is rolled out.</p>
<div>
<p> GitHub is continually expanding its AI-powered platform. Some of the features described in this article are in public preview, and may not be enabled for enterprises by default. You will find resources for each feature in the <a href="#get-started-with-agentic-ai">Get started with agentic AI</a> section.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#1-plan-with-copilot-chat">1. Plan with Copilot Chat</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To start planning, a product manager works with <strong>Copilot Chat</strong> at <code>https://github.com/copilot</code>.</p>
<p>They ask Copilot high-level questions to get a sense of the development work required for the new feature. To give Copilot access to important context about the project, they upload mockup files and link to the repository where the codebase is stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the PM has worked with Copilot to get an overview of the tasks required, they ask Copilot to <strong>create issues</strong> for each part of the work.</p>
<p>Copilot drafts the issues in immersive view, where the PM can refine them and publish them to the repository.</p>
<p>The PM marks some of the issues as nice-to-haves or maintenance. These may be good candidates for Copilot coding agent.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-177671/images/help/copilot/sdlc-guide/issue-creation.png" alt="Screenshot of Copilot Chat in immersive mode. Copilot asks if the user would like to proceed with creating a set of prioritized issues." width="720" height="361"></source></picture></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#2-create-with-github-models-and-agent-mode">2. Create with GitHub Models and agent mode</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The PM shares the results with the developer and asks the developer to start by finding the best AI model to provide the tailored umbrella recommendations, based on the cost and effectiveness of the models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer asks <strong>Copilot Chat</strong> to recommend several AI models for the job and the pros and cons of each. To provide useful context, they ask Copilot to consider the information in the <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task">Choosing the right AI model for your task</a> GitHub Docs article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To settle on a model from the shortlist, the developer uses the <strong>GitHub Models</strong> playground to compare results from the same prompt across models. They save time by testing models on a single platform, rather than needing to set up an API key for each model separately.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-352015/images/help/copilot/sdlc-guide/model-compare.png" alt="Screenshot of the GitHub Models playground, with windows for sending prompts to two models side by side." width="720" height="282"></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the model decided, the developer opens the code in <strong>VS Code</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer starts writing code for the new widget. To speed up their work, they use <strong>Copilot Chat</strong> in "Ask" and "Edit" mode for syntax questions and high-level suggestions.</p>
<div>
<p>
The developer works with AI in the way that works best for them, but your organization has control over the experience. For example, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Control the models</strong> that the developer can use for development work in order to meet compliance requirements and manage costs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exclude certain files</strong> from Copilot Chat's reach.</li>
<li>
<strong>Save effective prompts</strong> that have been tested with GitHub Models, so other users can benefit.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the developer has written some code, they switch to <strong>agent mode</strong> to ask Copilot to refactor the code into several different functions for better readability.</p>
<p>In agent mode, Copilot works more autonomously and is able to update multiple files and, with the developer's authorization, run commands for actions like installing dependencies or running tests.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-56951/images/help/copilot/sdlc-guide/agent-mode.png" alt="Screenshot of the Copilot Chat pane in VS Code. Copilot asks the user for permission to run a linting command." width="570" height="280"></source></picture></div>
<div>
<p> You can create a more consistent experience by adding a <strong>custom instructions</strong> file to the repository. For example, the file could help ensure that agent mode uses established naming conventions and runs the correct commands to build, test, and lint code according to your organization's standards.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer reviews the diff of the agent's work and chooses which code to keep.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#3-test-with-an-mcp-server">3. Test with an MCP server</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When the code is finished, the developer wants to run tests on their local build of the site using Playwright, an automated in-browser testing service.</p>
<ul>
<li>A repository administrator has added the <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP) server</strong> for Playwright, which gives the Copilot agent a predefined interface for integrating with Playwright.</li>
<li>The developer asks Copilot to outline test scenarios in a <code>.feature</code> file, then tells Copilot to run the tests in the browser.</li>
<li>In agent mode, Copilot asks the developer to authorize its actions as it opens the browser and clicks different elements in the UI. As the developer watches the tests in the browser, Copilot identifies a failing test and suggests a fix in the code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they're satisfied with the tests, the developer asks agent mode to open a pull request for the work on GitHub.</p>
<div>
<p> With the <strong>GitHub MCP server</strong> enabled, Copilot can run the command to open a pull request directly from VS Code, with the title and description already filled in.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#4-review-with-copilot-code-review">4. Review with Copilot code review</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>A repository owner has configured automatic <strong>code reviews</strong> by Copilot on the repository. Copilot provides an initial review on the pull request, identifying bugs and potential performance issues that the developer can fix before a human reviewer gets to the pull request.</li>
<li>The developer's colleague reviews and approves the pull request. The work is ready to merge.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#5-optimize-with-copilot-coding-agent">5. Optimize with Copilot coding agent</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After the release, the product manager collects customer feedback and identifies an opportunity to improve the widget's suggestions by switching to a more reliable API for weather data. They create an issue to implement this change, and <strong>assign it to Copilot</strong> directly on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copilot coding agent works in the background and opens a pull request, which the product manager marks as ready for review.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-148164/images/help/copilot/sdlc-guide/agent-pr.png" alt="Screenshot of a pull request created by Copilot coding agent."></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A developer reviews Copilot's pull request and leaves feedback, which Copilot incorporates. Finally, the developer merges the pull request.</p>
<div>
<p> Copilot coding agent comes with default guardrails. For example, Copilot cannot merge pull requests by itself. You can define additional protections for target branches using repository rulesets.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, while working on a separate feature, the developer notices a small bug in the code for the AI widget. To avoid context switching, the developer instructs Copilot to open a pull request directly from VS Code.</p>
<p><code>@github Create a PR for the widget function to correctly validate that the user's age is a positive integer.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copilot works in the background and opens a pull request on GitHub, ready for another developer to review.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#6-secure-with-copilot-autofix">6. Secure with Copilot Autofix</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An administrator has enabled code scanning on the repository, and a code scanning alert suggests a potential vulnerability in the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A security manager requests <strong>Copilot Autofix</strong> to automatically suggest a fix for the vulnerability, which a developer reviews and approves.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-84211/images/help/copilot/sdlc-guide/autofix.png" alt='Screenshot of a code scanning alert on GitHub.com. A button labeled "Generate fix" is outlined in orange.' width="720" height="187"></source></picture></div>
