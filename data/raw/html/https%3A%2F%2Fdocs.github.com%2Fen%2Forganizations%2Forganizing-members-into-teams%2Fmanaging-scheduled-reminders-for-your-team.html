<h2><a href="#about-scheduled-reminders-for-teams">About scheduled reminders for teams</a></h2>
<p>Scheduled reminders help teams focus on the most important review requests that require their attention. Scheduled reminders for pull requests will send a message to your team in Slack with all open pull requests that you or your team have been asked to review, at a specified time. For example, you can create a scheduled reminder to send a message to your team's main communication channel in Slack, including all open pull requests that the team is requested to review, every Wednesday at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Team maintainers and organization owners can set scheduled reminders for any pull requests that a team has been requested to review. Before you can create a scheduled reminder for your team, an organization owner must authorize your Slack workspace. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-scheduled-reminders-for-your-organization">Managing scheduled reminders for your organization</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub will only trigger reminders for up to five repositories per owner and 20 pull requests per repository. Reminders are not sent when changes are merged from upstream into a fork.</p>
