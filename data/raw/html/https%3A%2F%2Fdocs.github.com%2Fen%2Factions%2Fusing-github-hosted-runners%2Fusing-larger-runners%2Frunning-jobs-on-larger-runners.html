<p>Once your runner type has been defined, you can update your workflow YAML files to send jobs to your newly created runner instances for processing. You can use runner groups or labels to define where your jobs run.</p>
<div>
<p>
Larger runners are automatically assigned a default label that corresponds to the runner name. You cannot add custom labels to larger runners, but you can use the default labels or the runner's group to send jobs to specific types of runners.</p>
</div>
<p>Only owner or administrator accounts can see the runner settings. Non-administrative users can contact the organization owner to find out which runners are enabled. Your organization owner can create new runners and runner groups, as well as configure permissions to specify which repositories can access a runner group.

<h2><a href="#troubleshooting-larger-runners">Troubleshooting larger runners</a></h2>
<div>
<p>If you notice the jobs that target your larger runners are delayed or not running, there are several factors that may be causing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Concurrency settings:</strong> You may have reached your maximum concurrency limit. If you would like to enable more jobs to run in parallel, you can update your autoscaling settings to a larger number. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/managing-larger-runners#configuring-autoscaling-for-larger-runners">Managing larger runners</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Repository permissions:</strong> Ensure you have the appropriate repository permissions enabled for your larger runners. By default, enterprise runners are not available at the repository level and must be manually enabled by an organization administrator. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/managing-larger-runners#allowing-repositories-to-access-larger-runners">Managing larger runners</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Billing information:</strong> You must have a valid credit card on file in order to use larger runners. After adding a credit card to your account, it can take up to 10 minutes to enable the use of your larger runners. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-your-billing/managing-your-payment-and-billing-information">Managing your payment and billing information</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spending limit:</strong> Your GitHub Actions spending limit must be set to a value greater than zero. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/managing-your-spending-limit-for-github-actions">Managing your spending limit for GitHub Actions</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fair use policy:</strong> GitHub has a fair use policy that begins to throttle jobs based on several factors, such as how many jobs you are running or how many jobs are running across the entirety of GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Job queue to assign time:</strong> Job queue to assign time refers to the time between a job request and GitHub assigning a VM to execute the job. Standard GitHub-hosted runners utilizing prescribed YAML workflow labels (such as <code>ubuntu-latest</code>) are always in a "warm" state. With larger runners, a warm machine may not be ready to pick up a job on first request as the pools for these machines are smaller. As a result, GitHub may need to create a new VM, which increases the queue to assign time. Once a runner is in use, VMs are readily for subsequent workflow runs, reducing the queue to assign time for future workflow runs over the next 24 hours.</li>

<p>Because macOS arm64 does not support Node 12, macOS larger runners automatically use Node 16 to execute any JavaScript action written for Node 12. Some community actions may not be compatible with Node 16. If you use an action that requires a different Node version, you may need to manually install a specific version at runtime.</p>
