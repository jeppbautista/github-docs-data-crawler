<div><div><h1>Removing organization members from a team</h1></div></div>
<div><div><p>People with <em>owner</em> or <em>team maintainer</em> permissions can remove team members from a team. This may be necessary if a person no longer needs access to a repository the team grants, or if a person is no longer focused on a team's projects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div>
<p>Removing a member from a team revokes their access to all repositories and related resources granted through the team. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal from assignee fields in issues, pull requests, and project cards.</li>
<li>Loss of access to repository-specific tools such as GitHub Discussions, Projects, and Wikis.</li>
<li>Inability to contribute to any repositories the team has access to.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the member is assigned to any ongoing tasks, you should reassign them or grant them individual repository permissions, as required.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you remove a personâ€™s access to a private repository, any of their forks of that private repository are deleted. Local clones of the private repository are retained. If a team's access to a private repository is revoked or a team with access to a private repository is deleted, and team members do not have access to the repository through another team, private forks of the repository will be deleted.</li>
<li>You are responsible for ensuring that people who have lost access to a repository delete any confidential information or intellectual property.</li>
<li>People with admin permissions to a private repository can disallow forking of that repository, and organization owners can disallow forking of any private repository in an organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-organization">Managing the forking policy for your organization</a> and <a href="/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-the-forking-policy-for-your-repository">Managing the forking policy for your repository</a>.</li>
