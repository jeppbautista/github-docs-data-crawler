<p> The github.dev editor is currently in public preview. You can provide feedback <a href="https://github.com/community/community/discussions/categories/codespaces">in our Discussions</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#about-the-githubdev-editor">About the github.dev editor</a></h2>
<p>The github.dev editor introduces a lightweight editing experience that runs entirely in your browser. With the github.dev editor, you can navigate files and source code repositories from GitHub, and make and commit code changes. You can open any repository, fork, or pull request in the editor.</p>
<p>The github.dev editor is available to everyone for free on GitHub.com.</p>
<p>The github.dev editor provides many of the benefits of Visual Studio Code, such as search, syntax highlighting, and a source control view. You can also use Settings Sync to share your own VS Code settings with the editor. See <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">Settings Sync</a> in the VS Code documentation.</p>
<p>The github.dev editor runs entirely in your browser’s sandbox. The editor doesn’t clone the repository, but instead uses the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension">GitHub Repositories extension</a> to carry out most of the functionality that you will use. Your work is saved in the browser’s local storage until you commit it. You should commit your changes regularly to ensure that they're always accessible.</p>
<p>You must be signed in to GitHub to use the github.dev editor.</p>
<h2><a href="#opening-the-githubdev-editor">Opening the github.dev editor</a></h2>
<p>You can open any GitHub repository in github.dev in either of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To open the repository in the same browser tab, press <kbd>.</kbd> while browsing any repository or pull request on GitHub.</p>
<p>To open the repository in a new browser tab, press <kbd>&gt;</kbd>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the URL from "github.com" to "github.dev".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When viewing a file, select the <strong>github.dev</strong>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-37069/images/help/codespaces/github-dev-dropdown-option.png" alt='Screenshot of the dropdown menu for the edit icon. The option "github.dev" is highlighted with a dark orange outline.' width="720" height="202"></source></picture></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#codespaces-and-githubdev">Codespaces and github.dev</a></h2>
<p>Both github.dev and GitHub Codespaces allow you to edit your code straight from your repository. However, both have slightly different benefits, depending on your use case.</p>

<p>You can start your workflow in github.dev and continue working on a codespace. If you try to access the Run and Debug View or the Terminal, you'll be notified that they are not available in github.dev.</p>
<p>To continue your work in a codespace, click <strong>Continue Working on…</strong> and select <strong>Create New Codespace</strong> to create a codespace on your current branch. Before you choose this option, you must commit any changes.</p>

<h2><a href="#using-source-control">Using source control</a></h2>
<p>When you use github.dev, all actions are managed through the "Source Control" view, which is located in the Activity Bar on the left hand side. For more information on the "Source Control" view, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol">Version Control</a> in the VS Code documentation.</p>
<p>Because github.dev uses the GitHub Repositories extension to power its functionality, you can switch branches without needing to stash changes. See <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github#_github-repositories-extension">GitHub Repositories</a> in the VS Code documentation.</p>

<h2><a href="#using-extensions">Using extensions</a></h2>
<p>The github.dev editor supports VS Code extensions that have been specifically created or updated to run in the web. These extensions are known as "web extensions". To learn how you can create a web extension or update your existing extension to work for the web, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions">Web extensions</a> in the VS Code documentation.</p>
<p>Extensions that can run in github.dev will appear in the Extensions View and can be installed. If you use Settings Sync, any compatible extensions are also installed automatically. For information, see <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync">Settings Sync</a> in the VS Code documentation.</p>

<p>Every extension installed in github.dev is run under an independent web worker. This adds a layer of security between multiple extensions running in the same browser. As a result, request URLs coming from extensions are similar to this: <code>https://v--151hfiju3s93ktt2rqh65902gukb27osot905m4g52k40kaea3h6.vscode-cdn.net</code>.</p>
<p>Data is retrieved from the repository at runtime using the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.remotehub">GitHub Repositories</a> extension. This data is not stored on the local computer between github.dev sessions, with the exception of the browser storage of unsaved files and currently displayed files (to allow for page reloads). The only non-repository data that's stored locally between sessions are some user settings and the credentials sent by GitHub's authentication flow.</p>
<h2><a href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>If you have issues opening github.dev, try the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you are signed in to GitHub.</li>
<li>Disable any ad blockers.</li>
<li>Use a non-incognito window in your browser to open github.dev.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#known-limitations">Known limitations</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The github.dev editor is currently supported in Chrome (and various other Chromium-based browsers), Edge, Firefox, and Safari. We recommend that you use the latest versions of these browsers.</li>
<li>Some keybindings may not work, depending on the browser you are using. These keybinding limitations are documented in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces#_known-limitations-and-adaptations">Known limitations and adaptations</a> section of the VS Code documentation.</li>
<li>
<code>.</code> may not work to open github.dev according to your local keyboard layout. In that case, you can open any GitHub repository in github.dev by changing the URL from <code>github.com</code> to <code>github.dev</code>.</li>
<li>When intensively writing documentation or code in the web editor, you might encounter issues with pushing some commits. To resolve this, wait a few minutes for the API rate limit to reset.</li>
