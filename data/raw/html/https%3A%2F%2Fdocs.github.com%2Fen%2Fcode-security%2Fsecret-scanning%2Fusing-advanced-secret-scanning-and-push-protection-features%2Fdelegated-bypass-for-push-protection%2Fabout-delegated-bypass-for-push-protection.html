<p>By default, when push protection is enabled for a repository, anyone with write access can still push a secret to the repository, provided that they specify a reason for bypassing push protection.</p>
<p>With delegated bypass for push protection, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Choose</strong> which individuals, roles, and teams can bypass push protection.</li>
<li>Introduce a <strong>review and approval</strong> cycle for pushes containing secrets from all other contributors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Delegated bypass applies to files created, edited, and uploaded on GitHub.</p>
<p>To set up delegated bypass, organization owners or repository administrators create a list of users with bypass privileges. This designated list of users can then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bypass push protection, by specifying a reason for bypassing the block.</li>
<li>Manage (approve or deny) bypass requests coming from all other contributors. These requests are located in the "Push protection bypass" page in the <strong>Security</strong> tab of the repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following types of users can always bypass push protection without having to request bypass privileges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization owners</li>
<li>Security managers</li>
<li>Users in teams, default roles, or custom roles that have been added to the bypass list.</li>
<li>Users who are assigned (either directly or via a team) a custom role with the "review and manage secret scanning bypass requests" fine-grained permission.</li>
</ul>
