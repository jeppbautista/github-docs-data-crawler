<h2><a href="#about-choosing-a-security-configuration">About choosing a security configuration</a></h2>
<p>Security configurations are collections of enablement settings for GitHub's security features that you can apply to any repository within your organization. GitHub offers two types of security configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The GitHub-recommended security configuration</li>
<li>Custom security configurations</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We recommend that organizations initially apply the GitHub-recommended security configuration</em>. After you have applied the GitHub-recommended security configuration to repositories in your organization, you can evaluate the security findings for each repository and determine if you instead want to create and apply a custom security configuration.</p>
<p>Currently, only one security configuration can be applied to a repository at a time.</p>
<h2><a href="#choosing-the-github-recommended-security-configuration">Choosing the GitHub-recommended security configuration</a></h2>
<p>The GitHub-recommended security configuration offers a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is created and managed by GitHub's subject matter experts.</li>
<li>It is the quickest security configuration to apply to all repositories in your organization.</li>
<li>It is designed to effectively secure both low- and high-impact repositories.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GitHub-recommended security configuration includes GitHub Code Security and GitHub Secret Protection features. Applying the configuration to repositories in your organization will incur usage costs or require licenses.</p>
<p>To start securing repositories in your organization with the GitHub-recommended security configuration, see <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization">Applying the GitHub-recommended security configuration in your organization</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#choosing-a-custom-security-configuration">Choosing a custom security configuration</a></h2>
<p>If you are familiar with GitHub's security products, and you have specific security needs that the GitHub-recommended security configuration can't meet, you can create and apply custom security configurations. With custom security configurations, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the enablement settings for different security features</li>
<li>Create several configurations for repositories with different security needs</li>
<li>Control your usage and costs by including or excluding GitHub Code Security or GitHub Secret Protection features for a particular configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>To start securing repositories in your organization with custom security configurations, see <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/creating-a-custom-security-configuration">Creating a custom security configuration</a>.</p>
