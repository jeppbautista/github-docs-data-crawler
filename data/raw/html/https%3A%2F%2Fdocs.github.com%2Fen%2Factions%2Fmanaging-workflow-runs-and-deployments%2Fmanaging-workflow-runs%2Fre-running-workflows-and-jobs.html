<h2><a href="#about-re-running-workflows-and-jobs">About re-running workflows and jobs</a></h2>
<p>Re-running a workflow or jobs in a workflow uses the same <code>GITHUB_SHA</code> (commit SHA) and <code>GITHUB_REF</code> (Git ref) of the original event that triggered the workflow run. The workflow will use the privileges of the actor who initially triggered the workflow, not the privileges of the actor who initiated the re-run. You can re-run a workflow or jobs in a workflow for up to 30 days after the initial run. You cannot re-run jobs in a workflow once its logs have passed their retention limits. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy">Usage limits, billing, and administration</a>. When you re-run a workflow or jobs in a workflow, you can enable debug logging for the re-run. This will enable runner diagnostic logging and step debug logging for the re-run. For more information about debug logging, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging">Enabling debug logging</a></p>

<p>If any jobs in a workflow run failed, you can re-run just the jobs that failed. When you re-run failed jobs in a workflow, a new workflow run will start for all failed jobs and their dependents. Any outputs for any successful jobs in the previous workflow run will be used for the re-run. Any artifacts that were created in the initial run will be available in the re-run. Any deployment protection rules that passed in the previous run will automatically pass in the re-run.</p>

<h2><a href="#re-running-workflows-and-jobs-with-reusable-workflows">Re-running workflows and jobs with reusable workflows</a></h2>
<p>Reusable workflows from public repositories can be referenced using a SHA, a release tag, or a branch name. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow">Reusing workflows</a>.</p>
<p>When you re-run a workflow that uses a reusable workflow and the reference is not a SHA, there are some behaviors to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-running all jobs in a workflow will use the reusable workflow from the specified reference. For more information about re-running all jobs in a workflow, see <a href="/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs#re-running-all-the-jobs-in-a-workflow">Re-running workflows and jobs</a>.</li>
<li>Re-running failed jobs or a specific job in a workflow will use the reusable workflow from the same commit SHA of the first attempt. For more information about re-running failed jobs in a workflow, see <a href="/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/re-running-workflows-and-jobs#re-running-failed-jobs-in-a-workflow">Re-running workflows and jobs</a>.
