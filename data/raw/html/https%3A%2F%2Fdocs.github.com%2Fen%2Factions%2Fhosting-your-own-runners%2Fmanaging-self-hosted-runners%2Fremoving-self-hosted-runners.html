<li>This procedure permanently removes the self-hosted runner. If you only want to temporarily stop a runner from being assigned jobs, you can either shut down the machine or stop the <code>run</code> application. The runner will remain assigned in an "Offline" state, and won't execute any jobs until you restart the runner using the <code>run</code> application.</li>
<li>A self-hosted runner is automatically removed from GitHub if it has not connected to GitHub Actions for more than 14 days. An ephemeral self-hosted runner is automatically removed from GitHub if it has not connected to GitHub Actions for more than 1 day.</li>
<li>Just-in-time (JIT) runners can only run a single job. If JIT runners never run a job, they will automatically be removed. To remove a JIT runner before automatic removal, you must remove the JIT runner on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To remove a self-hosted runner from a user repository you must be the repository owner. Organization owners can remove a runner from a repository in the organization.</p>
<p>We recommend that you also have access to the self-hosted runner machine.</p>
<p>For information about how to remove a self-hosted runner with the REST API, see <a href="/en/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners">REST API endpoints for self-hosted runners</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don't have access to the repository or organization on GitHub to remove a runner, but you would like to re-use the runner machine, then you can delete the <code>.runner</code> file inside the self-hosted runner application directory (that is, the directory into which you downloaded and unpacked the runner software). This allows the runner to be registered without having to re-download the self-hosted runner application.</p>

<li>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under your repository name, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>

<p>In the list of runners, click on the name of the runner you'd like to configure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will see instructions for removing the self-hosted runner. Complete either of the following steps to remove the runner, depending on whether it is still accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If you have access to the runner machine:</strong> Follow the on-screen instructions for your machine's operating system to run the removal command. The instructions include the required URL and an automatically-generated, time-limited token.</p>
<p>The removal command does the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removes the runner from GitHub.</li>
<li>Removes any self-hosted runner application configuration files on the machine.</li>
<li>Removes any services configured if not running in interactive mode.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>If you don't have access to the machine:</strong> Click <strong>Force remove this runner</strong> to force GitHub to remove the runner.</p>
