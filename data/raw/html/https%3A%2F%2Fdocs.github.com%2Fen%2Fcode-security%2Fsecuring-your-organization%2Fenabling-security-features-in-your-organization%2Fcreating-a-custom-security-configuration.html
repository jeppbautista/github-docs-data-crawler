<h2><a href="#about-custom-security-configurations">About custom security configurations</a></h2>
<p>We recommend securing your organization with the GitHub-recommended security configuration, then evaluating the security findings on your repositories before configuring custom security configurations. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-the-github-recommended-security-configuration-in-your-organization">Applying the GitHub-recommended security configuration in your organization</a>.</p>
<p>With custom security configurations, you can create collections of enablement settings for GitHub's security products to meet the specific security needs of your organization. For example, you can create a different custom security configuration for each group of repositories to reflect their different levels of visibility, risk tolerance, and impact.</p>
<p>You can also choose whether or not you want to include GitHub Code Security or GitHub Secret Protection features in a configuration. If you do, keep in mind that these features incur usage costs (or require GitHub Advanced Security licenses) when applied to private and internal repositories. For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security">About GitHub Advanced Security</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
The order and names of some settings will differ depending on whether you are using licenses for the original GitHub Advanced Security product, or for the two new products: GitHub Code Security and GitHub Secret Protection. See <a href="#creating-a-github-advanced-security-configuration">Creating a GitHub Advanced Security configuration</a> or <a href="#creating-a-secret-protection-and-code-security-configuration">Creating a Secret Protection and Code Security configuration</a>.</p>

<p>Optionally, in the "Policy" section, you can use additional options to control how the configuration is applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Use as default for newly created repositories</strong>. Select the <strong>None</strong> <strong>Public</strong>, <strong>Private and internal</strong>, or <strong>All repositories</strong>.
<div>
<p>
The default security configuration for an organization is only automatically applied to new repositories created in your organization. If a repository is transferred into your organization, you will still need to apply an appropriate security configuration to the repository manually.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Enforce configuration</strong>. Block repository owners from changing features that are enabled or disabled by the configuration (features that are not set aren't enforced). Select <strong>Enforce</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To finish creating your custom security configuration, click <strong>Save configuration</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>
If a user in your enterprise attempts to change the enablement status of a feature in an enforced configuration using the REST API, the API call will appear to succeed, but no enablement statuses will change.</p>
<p>Some situations can break the enforcement of security configurations for a repository. For example, the enablement of code scanning will not apply to a repository if:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions is initially enabled on the repository, but is then disabled in the repository.</li>
<li>GitHub Actions required by code scanning configurations are not available in the repository.</li>
<li>The definition for which languages should not be analyzed using code scanning default setup is changed.</li>
