<h2><a href="#about-bypass-requests">About bypass requests</a></h2>
<p>If your organization has configured delegated bypass for push protection, a designated team of reviewers controls which organization members can push secrets to repositories in your organization, and which members must first make a "bypass request" in order to push the secret.</p>
<p>On the "Push protection bypass" page in security overview, reviewers can find, review (approve or deny) and manage these requests.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/secret-scanning/using-advanced-secret-scanning-and-push-protection-features/delegated-bypass-for-push-protection/managing-requests-to-bypass-push-protection">Managing requests to bypass push protection</a>.</p>
