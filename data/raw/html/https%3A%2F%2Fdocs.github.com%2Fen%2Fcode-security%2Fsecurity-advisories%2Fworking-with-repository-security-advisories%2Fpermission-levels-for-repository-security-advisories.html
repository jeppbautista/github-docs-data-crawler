<h3><a href="#permission-differences-for-global-security-advisories">Permission differences for global security advisories</a></h3>
<p>Unlike repository security advisories, anyone can contribute to <strong>global security advisories</strong> in the GitHub Advisory Database at <a href="https://github.com/advisories">github.com/advisories</a>. Edits to global advisories will not change or affect how the advisory appears on the repository. See <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/editing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database">Editing security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database</a>.</p>
