<p>The advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database are global security advisories. For more information about global security advisories, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-global-security-advisories-from-the-github-advisory-database/about-global-security-advisories">About global security advisories</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone can suggest improvements on any global security advisory in the GitHub Advisory Database by making a <strong>community contribution</strong>. A <strong>community contribution</strong> is a pull request submitted to the <a href="https://github.com/github/advisory-database">github/advisory-database</a> repository that improves the content of a global security advisory. When you make a community contribution, you can edit or add any detail, including additionally affected ecosystems, severity level or description of who is impacted. The GitHub Security Lab curation team will review the submitted contributions and publish them onto the GitHub Advisory Database if accepted.</p>
<p>If we accept and publish the community contribution, the person who submitted the community contribution pull request will automatically be assigned a credit type of "Analyst". For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory#about-credits-for-repository-security-advisories">Creating a repository security advisory</a>.</p>
<p>Only repository owners and administrators can edit repository-level security advisories. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/editing-a-repository-security-advisory">Editing a repository security advisory</a>.</p>
