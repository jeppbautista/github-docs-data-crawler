<h2><a href="#about-self-hosted-runners">About self-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>A self-hosted runner is a system that you deploy and manage to execute jobs from GitHub Actions on GitHub.</p>
<p>Self-hosted runners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give you more control of hardware, operating system, and software tools than GitHub-hosted runners provide.</li>
<li>Are free to use with GitHub Actions, but you are responsible for the cost of maintaining your runner machines.</li>
<li>Let you create custom hardware configurations that meet your needs with processing power or memory to run larger jobs, install software available on your local network.</li>
<li>Receive automatic updates for the self-hosted runner application only, though you may disable automatic updates of the runner.</li>
<li>Can use cloud services or local machines that you already pay for.</li>
<li>Don't need to have a clean instance for every job execution.</li>
<li>Can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use self-hosted runners anywhere in the management hierarchy. Repository-level runners are dedicated to a single repository, while organization-level runners can process jobs for multiple repositories in an organization. Organization owners can choose which repositories are allowed to create repository-level self-hosted runners. See <a href="/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#limiting-the-use-of-self-hosted-runners">Disabling or limiting GitHub Actions for your organization</a>. Finally, enterprise-level runners can be assigned to multiple organizations in an enterprise account.</p>
<h3><a href="#requirements-for-self-hosted-runner-machines">Requirements for self-hosted runner machines</a></h3>
<p>You can use any machine as a self-hosted runner as long at it meets these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can install and run the self-hosted runner application on the machine.</li>
<li>The machine can communicate with GitHub Actions.</li>
<li>The machine has enough hardware resources for the type of workflows you plan to run. The self-hosted runner application itself only requires minimal resources.</li>
<li>If you want to run workflows that use Docker container actions or service containers, you must use a Linux machine and Docker must be installed.</li>
</ul>
