This article applies to publishing apps in GitHub Marketplace only. For more information about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see <a href="/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace">Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Publisher verification ensures that GitHub has a way to contact you, that you've enabled two-factor authentication for your organization, and that your organization's domain has been verified.</p>
<p>Once your organization has been verified, you can publish paid plans for your app. For information, see <a href="/en/apps/github-marketplace/listing-an-app-on-github-marketplace/setting-pricing-plans-for-your-listing">Setting pricing plans for your listing</a>.</p>
<p>To offer paid plans for your app, the app must be owned by an organization and you must have owner permissions in the organization. If your app is currently owned by a personal account, you'll need to transfer the ownership of the app to an organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/apps/maintaining-github-apps/transferring-ownership-of-a-github-app">Transferring ownership of a GitHub App</a> or <a href="/en/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/transferring-ownership-of-an-oauth-app">Transferring ownership of an OAuth app</a>.</p>
