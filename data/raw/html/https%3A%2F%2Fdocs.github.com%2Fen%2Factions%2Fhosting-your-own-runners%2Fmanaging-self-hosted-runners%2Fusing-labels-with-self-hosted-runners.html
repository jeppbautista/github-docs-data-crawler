<p>For information on how to use labels to route jobs to specific types of self-hosted runners, see <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/using-self-hosted-runners-in-a-workflow">Using self-hosted runners in a workflow</a>. You can also route jobs to runners in a specific group. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-jobs/choosing-the-runner-for-a-job#targeting-runners-in-a-group">Choosing the runner for a job</a>.</p>
<p>A self-hosted runner can be located in either your repository, organization, or enterprise account settings on GitHub. To manage a self-hosted runner, you must have the following permissions, depending on where the self-hosted runner was added:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>User repository:</strong> You must be the repository owner.</li>
<li>
<strong>Organization:</strong> You must be an organization owner.</li>
<li>
<strong>Organization repository:</strong> You must be an organization owner, or have admin access to the repository.</li>
</ul>

Actions Runner Controller does not support multiple labels, to find out more please read our <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/about-actions-runner-controller#using-arc-runners-in-a-workflow">Actions Runner Controller documentation</a></p>

<h2><a href="#programmatically-assign-labels">Programmatically assign labels</a></h2>
<p>You can programmatically assign labels to a self-hosted runner after the runner is created, or during its initial configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To programmatically assign labels to an existing self-hosted runner, you must use the REST API. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/actions/self-hosted-runners">REST API endpoints for self-hosted runners</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To programmatically assign labels to a self-hosted runner during the initial runner configuration, you can pass label names to the <code>config</code> script using the <code>labels</code> parameter.</p>
<div>
<p>
You cannot use the <code>config</code> script to assign labels to an existing self-hosted runner.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, this command assigns a label named <code>gpu</code> when configuring a new self-hosted runner:</p>
<pre><code>./config.sh --url &lt;REPOSITORY_URL&gt; --token &lt;REGISTRATION_TOKEN&gt; --labels gpu
</code></pre>
<p>The label is created if it does not already exist. You can also use this approach to assign the default labels to runners, such as <code>x64</code> or <code>linux</code>. When default labels are assigned using the configuration script, GitHub Actions accepts them as given and does not validate that the runner is actually using that operating system or architecture.</p>
<p>You can use comma separation to assign multiple labels. For example:</p>
<pre><code>./config.sh --url &lt;REPOSITORY_URL&gt; --token &lt;REGISTRATION_TOKEN&gt; --labels gpu,x64,linux
</code></pre>
<div>
<p>
If you replace an existing runner, then you must reassign any custom labels.</p>
