<h2><a href="#troubleshooting-your-workflows">Troubleshooting your workflows</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways you can troubleshoot failed workflow runs.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-github-copilot">Using GitHub Copilot</a></h3>
<p>If a workflow run fails, you can open a chat with GitHub Copilot for assistance resolving the error. See <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/troubleshooting-workflows/using-copilot-to-troubleshoot-workflows">Using Copilot to troubleshoot workflows</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-workflow-run-logs">Using workflow run logs</a></h3>
<p>Each workflow run generates activity logs that you can view, search, and download. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/using-workflow-run-logs">Using workflow run logs</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#enabling-debug-logging">Enabling debug logging</a></h3>
<p>If the workflow logs do not provide enough detail to diagnose why a workflow, job, or step is not working as expected, you can enable additional debug logging. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/enabling-debug-logging">Enabling debug logging</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#canceling-a-workflow">Canceling a workflow</a></h3>
<p>If you attempt to cancel a workflow and the cancellation doesn't succeed, make sure you aren't using the <code>always</code> expression. The <code>always</code> expression causes a workflow step to run even when the workflow is canceled, which results in a hanging cancellation. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#always">Evaluate expressions in workflows and actions</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#troubleshooting-github-actions-inefficiencies">Troubleshooting GitHub Actions inefficiencies</a></h2>
<p>To analyze the inefficiencies and reliability of your workflows using metrics, see <a href="/en/actions/administering-github-actions/viewing-github-actions-metrics">Viewing GitHub Actions metrics</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#troubleshooting-self-hosted-runners">Troubleshooting self-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>If you use self-hosted runners, you can view their activity and diagnose common issues.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-self-hosted-runners">Monitoring and troubleshooting self-hosted runners</a>.</p>
