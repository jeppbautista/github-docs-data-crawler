<div>
<p>
Delegated alert dismissal is currently in public preview and subject to change.</p>
</div>
<p>Delegated alert dismissal lets you restrict which users can directly dismiss an alert. When the feature is enabled, users attempting to dismiss an alert will instead create a request for dismissal.</p>
<p>Enabling the feature automatically assigns organization owners and security managers with the permission to approve or deny dismissal requests for alerts. This permission is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Review and manage code scanning alert dismissal requests" permission for code scanning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Review and manage secret scanning alert dismissal requests" permission for secret scanning'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about these permissions, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization#permissions-for-organization-roles">Roles in an organization</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about the security manager role, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization">Managing security managers in your organization</a>.</p>
<div>
<p> The implementation of this approval process can potentially cause some friction, so it's important to ensure that the team of security managers has adequate coverage before proceeding.</p>
</div>
<p>Reviewers (security managers and organization owners):</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an email notification for requests. These users need to ensure that they can review these lists periodically, so that there is no backlog and that the process is smooth.</li>
<li>Can process requests in a dedicated view in the "Security" tab of the organization. An alert will only be dismissed if the dismissal request is approved; otherwise, the alert will remain open.</li>
</ul>
<p>Requesters will get an email notification with the decision as to whether the alert can be dismissed or not.</p>
<h2><a href="#configuring-delegated-dismissal-for-a-repository">Configuring delegated dismissal for a repository</a></h2>
<div>
<p> If an organization owner configures delegated alert dismissal via an enforced security configuration, the settings can't be changed at the repository level.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under your repository name, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the "Security" section of the sidebar, click </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under "Secret Protection", to the right of "Prevent direct alert dismissals", click <strong>Enable</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#configuring-delegated-dismissal-for-an-organization">Configuring delegated dismissal for an organization</a></h2>
<p>You must configure delegated dismissal for your organization using a custom security configuration. You can then apply the security configuration to all (or selected) repositories in your organization.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new custom security configuration, or edit an existing one. See <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/creating-a-custom-security-configuration#creating-a-custom-security-configuration">Creating a custom security configuration</a>.</li>
<li>When defining the custom security configuration, under "Secret scanning", ensure that the dropdown menu for "Prevent direct alert dismissals" is set to <strong>Enabled</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save configuration</strong>.</li>
<li>Apply the security configuration to all (or selected) repositories in your organization. See <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/applying-a-custom-security-configuration">Applying a custom security configuration</a>.</li>
