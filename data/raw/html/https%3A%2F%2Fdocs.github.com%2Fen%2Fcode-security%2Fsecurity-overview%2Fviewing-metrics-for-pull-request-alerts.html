<h2><a href="#about-codeql-pull-request-alerts-metrics">About CodeQL pull request alerts metrics</a></h2>
<p>The metrics overview for CodeQL pull request alerts helps you to understand how well CodeQL is preventing vulnerabilities in your organizations. You can use the metrics to assess how CodeQL is performing in pull requests, and to easily identify the repositories where you may need to take action in order to identify and reduce security risks.</p>
<p>The overview shows you a summary of how many vulnerabilities prevented by CodeQL have been caught in pull requests. The metrics are only tracked for pull requests that have been merged into the default branches of repositories in your organizations.</p>
<p>You can also find more granular metrics, such as how many alerts were fixed with and without Copilot Autofix suggestions, how many were unresolved and merged, and how many were dismissed as false positive or as risk accepted.</p>
<p>You can also view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The rules that are causing the most alerts, and how many alerts each rule is associated with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of alerts that were merged into the default branch without resolution, and the number of alerts dismissed as an acceptable risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of alerts that were fixed with an accepted Copilot Autofix suggestion, displayed as a fraction of how many total Copilot Autofix suggestions were available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remediation rates, in a graph showing the percentage of alerts that were remediated with an available Copilot Autofix suggestion, and the percentage of alerts that were remediated without a Copilot Autofix suggestion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply filters to the data. The metrics are based on activity from the default period or your selected period.</p>
<div>
<p> Metrics for Copilot Autofix will be shown only for repositories where Copilot Autofix is enabled.</p>
