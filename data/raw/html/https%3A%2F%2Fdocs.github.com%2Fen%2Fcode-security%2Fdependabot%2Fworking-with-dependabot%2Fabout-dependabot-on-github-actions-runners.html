<div>
<p>
If Dependabot is enabled for a repository, it will always run on GitHub Actions, <strong>bypassing both Actions policy checks and disablement at the repository or organization level</strong>. This ensures that security and version update workflows always run when Dependabot is enabled.</p>
</div>
<p>If you enable Dependabot on a new repository and have GitHub Actions enabled, Dependabot will run on GitHub Actions by default.</p>
<p>If you enable Dependabot on a new repository and have GitHub Actions disabled, Dependabot will run on the legacy application in GitHub to perform Dependabot updates. This doesn't provide as good performance, visibility, or control of Dependabot updates jobs as GitHub Actions does. If you want to use Dependabot with GitHub Actions, you must ensure that your repository enables GitHub Actions, then enable "Dependabot on Actions runners" from the repository's "Advanced Security" settings page.</p>
<div>
<p> Future releases of GitHub will always run Dependabot using GitHub Actions, and you will no longer have the option to enable or disable this setting.</p>
</div>
<p>Using GitHub Actions runners allows you to more easily identify Dependabot job errors and manually detect and troubleshoot failed runs. You can also integrate Dependabot into your CI/CD pipelines by using GitHub Actions APIs and webhooks to detect Dependabot job status such as failed runs, and perform downstream processing. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/actions">REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions</a> and <a href="/en/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads">Webhook events and payloads</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
Running Dependabot on GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners <strong>does not</strong> count towards your included GitHub Actions minutes. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">About billing for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can run Dependabot on GitHub Actions using:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub-hosted runners</li>
<li>Larger runners. These runners are GitHub-hosted, with advanced features, such as more RAM, CPU, and disk space. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners">Using larger runners</a>.</li>
<li>Self-hosted runners. For more information on assigning a <code>dependabot</code> label on self-hosted runners, see <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/maintain-dependencies/managing-dependabot-on-self-hosted-runners">Managing Dependabot on self-hosted runners</a>.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>
Private networking is supported with either an Azure Virtual Network (VNET) or the Actions Runner Controller (ARC) for Dependabot on GitHub Actions. See <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/setting-dependabot-to-run-on-self-hosted-runners-using-arc">Setting up Dependabot to run on self-hosted action runners using the Actions Runner Controller</a> and <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/setting-dependabot-to-run-on-github-hosted-runners-using-vnet">Setting up Dependabot to run on github-hosted action runners using the Azure Private Network</a> for more information, and instruction.</p>
</div>
<p>Enabling Dependabot on GitHub Actions may increase the number of concurrent jobs run in your account. If required, customers on enterprise plans can request a higher limit for concurrent jobs. For more information, contact us through the <a href="https://support.github.com/">GitHub Support portal</a>, or contact your sales representative.</p>
<p>If you are transitioning to using Dependabot on GitHub Actions runners and you restrict access to your organization's or repository's private resources, you may need to update your list of allowed IP addresses. For example, if you currently limit access to your private resources to the IP addresses that Dependabot uses, you should update your allowlist to use the GitHub-hosted runners IP addresses sourced from the meta API endpoint. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/meta">REST API endpoints for meta data</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
Dependabot on GitHub Actions relies on the <code>ubuntu-latest</code> label to select the appropriate runner. To ensure Dependabot  runs on GitHub-hosted runners, you should not use the label <code>ubuntu-latest</code> for self-hosted runners.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#enabling-or-disabling-dependabot-on-github-hosted-runners">Enabling or disabling Dependabot on GitHub-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>This section only applies to standard GitHub-hosted runners, not larger runners.</p>
<p>New repositories that you create in your user account or in your organization will automatically be configured to run Dependabot on GitHub Actions if any of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dependabot is installed and enabled, and GitHub Actions is enabled and in use.</li>
<li>The "Dependabot on GitHub Actions runners" setting for your organization is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>For existing repositories, you can opt in to run Dependabot on GitHub Actions as follows.</p>
<p>Future releases of GitHub will remove the ability to disable running Dependabot on GitHub Actions.</p>
<p>If you restrict access to your organization's or repository's private resources, you may need to update your list of allowed IP addresses prior to enabling Dependabot on GitHub Actions runners. You can update your IP allow list to use the GitHub-hosted runners IP addresses (instead of the Dependabot IP addresses), sourced from the <a href="/en/rest/meta">meta</a> REST API endpoint.</p>
<div>
<p> You should not rely on the GitHub Actions IP addresses for authentication to private registries. These GitHub Actions addresses are not only used by GitHub, and should not be trusted for authentication. Instead, use a self-hosted runner to ensure greater control over your network access. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/dependabot/maintain-dependencies/managing-dependabot-on-self-hosted-runners">Managing Dependabot on self-hosted runners</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Note, disabling and re-enabling the "Dependabot on GitHub Actions runners" settings will not trigger a new Dependabot run.</p>
