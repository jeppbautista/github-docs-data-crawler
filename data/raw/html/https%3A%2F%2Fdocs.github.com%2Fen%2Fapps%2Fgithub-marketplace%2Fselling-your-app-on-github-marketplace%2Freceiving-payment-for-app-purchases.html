This article applies to publishing apps in GitHub Marketplace only. For more information about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see <a href="/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace">Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>

<p>After your GitHub Marketplace listing for an app with a paid plan is created and approved, you'll provide payment details to GitHub as part of the financial onboarding process.</p>
<p>Once your revenue reaches a minimum of 500 US dollars for the month, you'll receive an electronic payment from GitHub at the end of the following month. This will be the income from marketplace transactions minus the amount charged by GitHub to cover their running costs.</p>
<p>For transactions made before January 1, 2021, GitHub retains 25% of transaction income. For transactions made after that date, only 5% is retained by GitHub. This change will be reflected in payments received from the end of January 2021 onward.</p>
