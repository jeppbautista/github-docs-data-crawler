<p>If an organization only has one owner, the organization's projects can become inaccessible if the owner is unreachable. To ensure that no one will lose access to a project, we recommend that at least two people within each organization have the owner role.</p>
<p>Organization owners have full administrative access to the organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/roles-in-an-organization">Roles in an organization</a>.</p>

As an organization owner, you can change the role of other organization members and owners. You can't change your own role.</p>
