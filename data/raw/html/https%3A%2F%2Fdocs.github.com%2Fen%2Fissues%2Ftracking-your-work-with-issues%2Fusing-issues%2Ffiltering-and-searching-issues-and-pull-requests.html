You can also filter issues or pull requests using the GitHub CLI. For more information, see <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_list"><code>gh issue list</code></a> or <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_list"><code>gh pr list</code></a> in the GitHub CLI documentation.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#filtering-issues-and-pull-requests">Filtering issues and pull requests</a></h2>
<p>Issues and pull requests come with a set of default filters you can apply to organize your listings.</p>
<p>You can filter issues and pull requests to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>All open issues and pull requests</li>
<li>Issues and pull requests that you've created</li>
<li>Issues and pull requests that are assigned to you</li>
<li>Issues and pull requests where you're <a href="/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams"><strong>@mentioned</strong></a>

<h2><a href="#building-advanced-filters-for-issues">Building advanced filters for issues</a></h2>
<p>You can build advanced filters using boolean and nested queries on your repository's issues page and the issues dashboard. As you type your filter, GitHub will show available qualifiers, suggest values, and warn when there is a problem with your filter.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-boolean-operators">Using boolean operators</a></h3>
<p>You can use <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> operators to refine your filters.</p>
<p>Use <code>AND</code> when you need results where both statements are true. In the example filter below, the results will be comprised of issues with the "question" label that are assigned to the @octocat user.</p>
<pre><code>label:"question" AND assignee:octocat
</code></pre>
<p>To return results where either statement is true, use <code>OR</code>. In the example below, the results will contain issues assigned to either @octocat or @hubot.</p>
<pre><code>assignee:octocat OR assignee:hubot
</code></pre>
<p>If you choose not to use <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> operators, GitHub will treat a space between statements as an <code>AND</code> operator.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-parentheses-for-more-complicated-filters">Using parentheses for more complicated filters</a></h3>
<p>You can also use parentheses to nest filters and group qualifiers. In the example below, the results will contain issues that are either assigned to @octocat with the "bug" issue type or assigned to @hubot with the "Feature" issue type.</p>
<pre><code>(type:"Bug" AND assignee:octocat) OR (type:"Feature" AND assignee:hubot)
</code></pre>
<p>You can nest filters using parentheses up to five levels deep.</p>

<h2><a href="#using-search-to-filter-issues-and-pull-requests">Using search to filter issues and pull requests</a></h2>

<h3><a href="#searching-for-issues-and-pull-requests">Searching for issues and pull requests</a></h3>
<div>
<p>The issues and pull requests search bar allows you to define your own custom filters and sort by a wide variety of criteria.

To learn more about GitHub CLI, see <a href="/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli">About GitHub CLI</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can use the GitHub CLI to search for issues or pull requests. Use the <code>gh issue list</code> or <code>gh pr list</code> subcommand along with the <code>--search</code> argument and a search query.</p>
<p>For example, you can list, in order of date created, all issues that have no assignee and that have the label <code>help wanted</code> or <code>bug</code>.</p>
<pre><code>gh issue list --search 'no:assignee label:"help wanted",bug sort:created-asc'
</code></pre>
<p>You can also list all pull requests that mention the <code>octo-org/octo-team</code> team.</p>
<pre><code>gh pr list --search "team:octo-org/octo-team"
</code></pre>
</div>
<h3><a href="#about-search-terms">About search terms</a></h3>
