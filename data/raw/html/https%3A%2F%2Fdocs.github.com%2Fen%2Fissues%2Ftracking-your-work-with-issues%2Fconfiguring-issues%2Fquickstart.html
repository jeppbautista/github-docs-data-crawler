<h2><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This guide demonstrates how to use GitHub Issues to plan and track a piece of work. In this guide, you will create a new issue and add a task list to track sub-tasks. You'll also learn how to add labels, milestones, assignees, and projects to communicate metadata about your issue.</p>
<h2><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>To create an issue, you need a repository. You can use an existing repository that you have write access to, or you can create a new repository.  The repository must have issues enabled. For more information about creating a repository, see <a href="/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository">Creating a new repository</a>. For more information about enabling issues if they are disabled in your repository, see <a href="/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/disabling-issues">Disabling issues</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#opening-a-blank-issue">Opening a blank issue</a></h2>
<p>First, create an issue. There are multiple ways to create an issue; you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. This example will use the GitHub UI. For more information about other ways to create an issue, see <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue">Creating an issue</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under your repository name, click </p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-51267/images/help/repository/repo-tabs-issues-global-nav-update.png" alt='Screenshot of the main page of a repository. In the horizontal navigation bar, a tab, labeled "Issues," is outlined in dark orange.' width="1440" height="115"></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>New issue</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this example, we will start with a blank issue. Your repository may use issue templates and issue forms to encourage contributors to provide specific information. If your repository uses issue templates, click <strong>Open a blank issue</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#filling-in-information">Filling in information</a></h2>
<p>Give your issue a descriptive title. The title should convey at a glance what the issue is about.</p>
<p>Add a description that explains the purpose of the issue, including any details that might help resolve the issue. For example, if this is a bug report, describe the steps to reproduce the bug, the expected result, and the actual result.</p>
<p>You can use markdown to add formatting, links, emojis, and more. For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/writing-on-github">Writing on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-72505/images/help/issues/issue-title-body.png" alt="Screenshot of the new issue form, with a title and body filled in." width="720" height="493"></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#adding-a-task-list">Adding a task list</a></h2>
<p>It can be helpful to break large issues into smaller tasks, or to track multiple related issues in a single larger issue. Add a task list to your issue by prefacing list items with <code>[ ]</code>. Reference existing issues by issue number or URL. You can use plain text to track tasks that don't have a corresponding issue and convert them to issues later. For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/about-task-lists">About tasklists</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-83921/images/help/issues/issue-task-list-raw.png" alt="Screenshot of the new issue form, with the title and body filled in. The body includes the Markdown for a task list." width="720" height="483"></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#adding-labels">Adding labels</a></h2>
<p>Add a label to categorize your issue. For example, you might use a <code>bug</code> label and a <code>good first issue</code> label to indicate that an issue is a bug that a first-time contributor could pick up. Users can filter issues by label to find all issues that have a specific label.</p>
<p>You can use the default labels, or you can create a new label. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels">Managing labels</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-116676/images/help/issues/issue-with-label.png" alt='Screenshot of the new issue form. In the right sidebar, the "Labels" section is outlined in dark orange.'></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#adding-milestones">Adding milestones</a></h2>
<p>You can add a milestone to track the issue as part of a date based target. A milestone will show the progress of the issues as the target date approaches. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/about-milestones">About milestones</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-119294/images/help/issues/issue-milestone.png" alt='Screenshot of the new issue form. In the right sidebar, the "Milestone" section is outlined in dark orange.' width="720" height="368"></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#assigning-the-issue">Assigning the issue</a></h2>
<p>To communicate responsibility, you can assign the issue to a member of your organization. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users">Assigning issues and pull requests to other GitHub users</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-121639/images/help/issues/issue-assignees.png" alt='Screenshot of the new issue form. In the right sidebar, the "Assignees" section is outlined in a dark orange.' width="720" height="373"></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#adding-the-issue-to-a-project">Adding the issue to a project</a></h2>
<p>You can add the issue to an existing project and populate metadata for the project. For more information about projects, see <a href="/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">About Projects</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-122140/images/help/issues/issue-project.png" alt='Screenshot of the new issue form. In the right sidebar, the "Projects" section is outlined in dark orange.' width="720" height="373"></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#submitting-your-issue">Submitting your issue</a></h2>
<p>Click <strong>Submit new issue</strong> to create your issue. You can edit any of the above fields after creating the issue. Your issue has a unique URL that you can share with team members, or reference in other issues or pull requests.</p>
<h2><a href="#communicating">Communicating</a></h2>
<p>After your issue is created, continue the conversation by adding comments to the issue. You can @mention collaborators or teams to draw their attention to a comment. To link related issues in the same repository, you can type <code>#</code> followed by part of the issue title and then clicking the issue that you want to link. For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/writing-on-github">Writing on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-31776/images/help/issues/issue-comment.png" alt='Screenshot of an issue comment. The header says "octocat commented now" and the body says "@hubot Do we also need to update the rocket logic?"' width="720" height="123"></source></picture></p>
<h2><a href="#next-steps">Next steps</a></h2>
<p>You can use issues for a wide range of purposes. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking ideas</li>
<li>Collecting feedback</li>
<li>Planning tasks</li>
<li>Reporting bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>To break your issue down into more manageable tasks, you can add multiple levels of sub-issues. See <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/adding-sub-issues">Adding sub-issues</a>.</p>
