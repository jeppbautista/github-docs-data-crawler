<h2><a href="#github-codespaces-features">GitHub Codespaces features</a></h2>
<h3><a href="#preconfigured-development-environments">Preconfigured development environments</a></h3>
<p>You can work in a development environment that has been specifically configured for the repository. It will have all of the tools, languages, and configurations you need to work on that project. Everyone who works on that repository in a codespace will have the same environment. This reduces the likelihood of environment-related problems occurring and being difficult to debug. Each repository can have settings that will give contributors a ready-to-use, fit-for-purpose environment, and the environment on your local machine will be unchanged.</p>
<h3><a href="#access-the-resources-you-need">Access the resources you need</a></h3>
<p>Your local computer may not have the processing power, or storage space, you need to work on a project. GitHub Codespaces allows you to work remotely on a machine with adequate resources.</p>
<h3><a href="#work-anywhere">Work anywhere</a></h3>
<p>All you need is a web browser. You can work in a codespace on your own computer, on a friend's laptop, or on a tablet. Open your codespace and pick up from where you left off on a different device.</p>
<h3><a href="#choose-your-editor">Choose your editor</a></h3>
<p>Work in the browser, using the VS Code web client or JupyterLab, or in the desktop-based VS Code application.</p>
<h3><a href="#work-on-multiple-projects">Work on multiple projects</a></h3>
<p>You can use multiple codespaces to work on separate projects, or on different branches of the same repository, compartmentalizing your work to avoid changes made for one piece of work accidentally affecting something else you're working on.</p>
<h3><a href="#pair-program-with-a-teammate">Pair program with a teammate</a></h3>
<p>If you work on a codespace in VS Code, you can use Live Share to work collaboratively with other people on your team. See <a href="/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/working-collaboratively-in-a-codespace">Working collaboratively in a codespace</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#publish-your-web-app-from-a-codespace">Publish your web app from a codespace</a></h3>
<p>Forward a port from your codespace and then share the URL, to allow teammates to try out the changes you've made to the application before you submit those changes in a pull request.</p>
<h3><a href="#try-out-a-framework">Try out a framework</a></h3>
<p>GitHub Codespaces reduces the setup time when you want to learn a new framework. Just create a codespace from one of the <a href="https://github.com/codespaces/templates">quickstart templates</a>.</p>
