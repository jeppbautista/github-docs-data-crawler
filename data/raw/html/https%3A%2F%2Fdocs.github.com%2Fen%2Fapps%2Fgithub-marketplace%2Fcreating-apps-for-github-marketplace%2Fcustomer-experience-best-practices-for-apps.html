This article applies to publishing apps in GitHub Marketplace only. For more information about publishing GitHub Actions in GitHub Marketplace, see <a href="/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace">Publishing actions in GitHub Marketplace</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you follow these best practices it will help you to provide a good customer experience.</p>
<h2><a href="#customer-communication">Customer communication</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Marketing materials for the app should accurately represent the app's behavior.</li>
<li>Apps should include links to user-facing documentation that describe how to set up and use the app.</li>
<li>Customers should be able to see what type of plan they have in the billing, profile, or account settings section of the app.</li>
<li>Customers should be able to install and use your app on both a personal account and an organization account. They should be able to view and manage the app on those accounts separately.</li>
<li>Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#plan-management">Plan management</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Customers who cancel a paid plan purchased from GitHub Marketplace should be automatically downgraded to the app's free plan if it exists. When a customer cancels a GitHub Marketplace subscription, GitHub does not automatically uninstall the app, so the customer can expect that free features will continue to function. It's highly recommended to allow customers to re-enable their previous plan.</li>
<li>Customers should be able to upgrade from your app's user interface if you provide an <a href="/en/apps/publishing-apps-to-github-marketplace/using-the-github-marketplace-api-in-your-app/handling-plan-changes#about-upgrade-urls">upgrade URL</a> in this format: <code>https://www.github.com/marketplace/&lt;LISTING_NAME&gt;/upgrade/&lt;LISTING_PLAN_NUMBER&gt;/&lt;CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_ID&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>Customers should be able to modify which users have access to your app from your app's website if they purchased seats (per-unit pricing plan) or the plan offers unlimited collaborators.</li>
<li>Customers should be able to see the following changes to their account immediately in the billing, profile, or account settings section of the app's website:
<ul>
<li>Current plan and price.</li>
<li>New plans purchased.</li>
<li>Upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and the number of remaining days in a free trial.</li>
<li>Changes to billing cycles (monthly or yearly).</li>
<li>Usage and remaining resources for flat-rate and per-unit plans. For example, if the pricing plan is per-unit, your app's site should show units used and units available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
