<p>If you rely on using forks of your private repositories, you can configure policies that control how users can run workflows on <code>pull_request</code> events. Available to private repositories only, you can configure these policy settings for organizations or repositories. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-policies-for-github-actions-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-fork-pull-requests-in-private-repositories">Enforcing policies for GitHub Actions in your enterprise</a>.</p>

<p>Maintainers with write access to a repository can use the following procedure to review and run workflows on pull requests from contributors that require approval.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Under your repository name, click </p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-51156/images/help/repository/repo-tabs-pull-requests-global-nav-update.png" alt='Screenshot of the main page of a repository. In the horizontal navigation bar, a tab, labeled "Pull requests," is outlined in dark orange.' width="1440" height="115"></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the list of pull requests, click the pull request you'd like to review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the pull request, click </p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-23571/images/help/pull_requests/pull-request-tabs-changed-files.png" alt='Screenshot of the tabs for a pull request. The "Files changed" tab is outlined in dark orange.' width="654" height="61"></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspect the proposed changes in the pull request and ensure that you are comfortable running your workflows on the pull request branch. You should be especially alert to any proposed changes in the <code>.github/workflows/</code> directory that affect workflow files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are comfortable with running workflows on the pull request branch, return to the <strong>Approve and run</strong>.</p>
