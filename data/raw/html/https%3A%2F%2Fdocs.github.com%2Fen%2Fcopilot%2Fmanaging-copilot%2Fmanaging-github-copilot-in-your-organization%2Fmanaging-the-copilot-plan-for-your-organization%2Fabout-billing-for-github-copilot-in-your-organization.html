<h2><a href="#about-pricing-for-copilot-in-your-organization">About pricing for Copilot in your organization</a></h2>
<p>Copilot Business plans are available on a monthly cycle. The plans are billed at the end of each cycle, at $19 USD per user per month.</p>
<h2><a href="#premium-requests">Premium requests</a></h2>
<p>Paid Copilot plans include premium requests. Premium requests use advanced models and features and are subject to monthly allowances or potential overage costs. See <a href="/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-copilot-as-an-individual-subscriber/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/avoiding-unexpected-copilot-costs">About premium requests</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#about-the-billing-cycle-for-copilot-in-your-organization">About the billing cycle for Copilot in your organization</a></h2>
<p>Billed users are calculated at the end of each billing cycle, based on the number of GitHub Copilot seats that are assigned. You can add or remove seats at any time during the billing cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Any seat assigned part way through the billing cycle</strong> will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in the cycle.</li>
<li>
<strong>Any seat assignment removed during a billing cycle</strong> will take effect from the beginning of the next cycle. The person will still be able to use GitHub Copilot until the end of the cycle. If a user's access to the organization itself is removed, they will lose access immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your organization belongs to an enterprise, your enterprise will be charged on whichever payment method youâ€™ve set up for the organization account, such as a credit card or a Microsoft Azure subscription.</p>
<p>Note that GitHub may apply a temporary authorization hold for the value of the usage-based costs in advance, which will appear as a pending charge in your account's payment method.</p>
<div>
<p> GitHub Copilot billing operates in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), but it calculates your bill according to the timezone of your billing cycle. For example, if you're billed through Azure and your current billing cycle ends at 11:59 PM EST on December 1st, canceling a seat at 7:00 PM EST on December 1st might show the seat cancellation at 12:00 AM UTC on December 2nd. However, the seat would end within the billing cycle that you requested the cancellation, and you would not pay for that seat in the following cycle.</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#about-seat-assignment-for-copilot-in-your-organization">About seat assignment for Copilot in your organization</a></h3>
<p>A Copilot seat is a license to use Copilot, which is granted to a unique user account through an organization's Copilot Business plan. Each month, the organization is charged for the number of assigned seats.</p>
<p>Removing all assigned Copilot seats in your organization will cancel your organization's Copilot plan.</p>
<p>Seat assignment is managed by organization owners. See <a href="/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization/granting-access-to-copilot-for-members-of-your-organization">Granting access to Copilot for members of your organization</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a member of an organization with a Copilot plan, to use Copilot, you will need to be assigned a seat by an organization owner.</p>
<p>If you have an active Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+ plan, and are then assigned a seat as part of a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, your personal Copilot plan will be automatically canceled. You will receive a prorated refund for any remaining portion of your personal plan's current billing cycle. You will then be able to continue using Copilot according to the policies set by your company.</p>
<h3><a href="#about-billing-through-azure">About billing through Azure</a></h3>
<p>When you connect an Azure subscription to your organization account and enable metered billing via Azure, metered usage will start to be sent to Azure. You will be billed through GitHub for usage from the start of the current billing cycle to when you enabled metered billing via Azure, on your next billing date. The period between the date you connected your Azure subscription and enabled metered billing via Azure, and the end of the calendar month will be charged in Azure on the first of the month. For more information, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/connecting-an-azure-subscription">Connecting an Azure subscription</a>.</p>
<div>
<p> Usage data is sent to Azure daily, but you are billed at the end of the month based on the number of seats used. This means that although you can track your daily spending (number of seats in this case), actual payments are processed monthly.</p>
