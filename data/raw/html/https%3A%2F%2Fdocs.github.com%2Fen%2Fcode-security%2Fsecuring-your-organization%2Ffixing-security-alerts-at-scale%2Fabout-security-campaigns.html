<p>Once you have identified security alerts in the default branches of your repositories, the next step is to identify the most urgent alerts and get them fixed. Security campaigns are a way to group alerts and share them with developers, so you can collaborate to remediate vulnerabilities in the code.</p>
<h2><a href="#security-campaigns-in-your-day-to-day-work">Security campaigns in your day-to-day work</a></h2>
<p>You can use security campaigns to support many of your aims as a security leader.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the security posture of the company by leading work to remediate alerts.</li>
<li>Reinforcing security training for developers by creating a campaign of related alerts to fix collaboratively.</li>
<li>Building collaborative relationships between the security team and developers to promote shared ownership of security alerts.</li>
<li>Providing clarity to developers on the most urgent alerts to fix and monitoring alert remediation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#benefits-of-using-security-campaigns">Benefits of using security campaigns</a></h2>
<p>A security campaign has many benefits over other ways of encouraging developers to remediate security alerts. In particular,</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers are notified about any security campaigns taking place in repositories they work in or subscribe to by email.</li>
<li>Developers can see the alerts you've highlighted for remediation without leaving their normal workflows.</li>
<li>Each campaign has a named point of contact for questions, reviews, and collaboration.</li>
<li>GitHub Copilot Autofix is automatically triggered to suggest a resolution for each security alert.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use one of the templates to select a group of closely related alerts for a campaign. This allows developers to build on the knowledge gained by resolving one alert and use it to fix several more, providing them with an incentive to fix multiple alerts.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use the REST API to create and interact with campaigns more efficiently and at scale. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/campaigns/campaigns">REST API endpoints for security campaigns</a>.</p>
