<p>The user-generated description found on a profile: <a href="/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile">Adding a bio to your profile</a></p>
<h2><a href="#blame">blame</a></h2>
<p>The "blame" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.</p>
<h2><a href="#block">block</a></h2>
<p>To remove a user's ability to collaborate on an organization's repositories.</p>
<h2><a href="#branch">branch</a></h2>
<p>A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.</p>
<h2><a href="#branch-restriction">branch restriction</a></h2>
<p>A restriction that repository admins can enable so that only certain users or teams can push or make certain changes to the branch.</p>
<h2><a href="#business-plan">Business plan</a></h2>

<h2><a href="#check">check</a></h2>
<p>A check is a type of status check on GitHub. See <a href="#status-checks">Status checks</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#checkout">checkout</a></h2>
<p>You can use <code>git checkout</code> on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch with <code>git checkout [branchname] [path to file]</code>. The "checkout" action updates all or part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updates the index and HEAD if the whole working tree is pointing to a new branch.</p>
<h2><a href="#cherry-picking">cherry-picking</a></h2>
<p>To choose a subset of changes from a series of changes (typically commits) and record them as a new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In Git, this is performed by the <code>git cherry-pick</code> command to extract the change introduced by an existing commit on another branch and to record it based on the tip of the current branch as a new commit. For more information, see <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick">git-cherry-pick</a> in the Git documentation.</p>

<h2><a href="#clone">clone</a></h2>
<p>A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.</p>
<h2><a href="#clustering">clustering</a></h2>
<p>The ability to run GitHub Enterprise services across multiple nodes and load balance requests between them.</p>
<h2><a href="#code-frequency-graph">code frequency graph</a></h2>

<h2><a href="#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a></h2>
<p>A document that defines standards for how to engage in a community.</p>
<h2><a href="#code-owner">code owner</a></h2>
<p>A person who is designated as an owner of a portion of a repository's code. The code owner is automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request (not in draft mode) that makes changes to code the code owner owns.</p>
<h2><a href="#collaborator">collaborator</a></h2>
<p>A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.</p>
<h2><a href="#commit">commit</a></h2>
<p>A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.</p>
<h2><a href="#commit-author">commit author</a></h2>
<p>The user who makes the commit.</p>
<h2><a href="#commit-graph">commit graph</a></h2>
<p>A repository graph that shows all the commits made to a repository in the past year.</p>
<h2><a href="#commit-id">commit ID</a></h2>
<p>Also known as SHA. A 40-character checksum hash that identifies the commit.</p>
<h2><a href="#commit-message">commit message</a></h2>
<p>Short, descriptive text that accompanies a commit and communicates the change the commit is introducing.</p>
<h2><a href="#compare-branch">compare branch</a></h2>
<p>The branch you use to create a pull request. This branch is compared to the base branch you choose for the pull request, and the changes are identified. When the pull request is merged, the base branch is updated with the changes from the compare branch. Also known as the "head branch" of the pull request.</p>
<h2><a href="#continuous-integration">continuous integration</a></h2>
<p>Also known as CI. A process that runs automated builds and tests once a person commits a change to a configured repository on GitHub. CI is a common best practice in software development that helps detect errors.</p>
<h2><a href="#contribution-graph">contribution graph</a></h2>
<p>The part of a user's profile that shows their contributions over a period of up to one year, day by day.</p>

<p>When you successfully push a branch to a remote repository, you update the remote branch with changes from your local branch. When you "push a branch", Git will search for the branch's HEAD ref in the remote repository and verify that it is a direct ancestor to the branch's local HEAD ref. Once verified, Git pulls all objects (reachable from the local HEAD ref and missing from the remote repository) into the remote object database and then updates the remote HEAD ref. If the remote HEAD is not an ancestor to the local HEAD, the push fails.</p>

<h2><a href="#topic-branch">topic branch</a></h2>
<p>A regular Git branch that is used by a developer to identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy and inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small branches that each contain very well defined concepts or small incremental yet related changes. Can also be called a feature branch.</p>
<h2><a href="#topics">topics</a></h2>

<h2><a href="#upstream">upstream</a></h2>
<p>When talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the "upstream", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the "downstream." Also called origin.</p>
<h2><a href="#upstream-branch">upstream branch</a></h2>
<p>The default branch that is merged into the branch in question (or the branch in question is rebased onto). It is configured via <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</code> and <code>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</code>. If the upstream branch of A is origin/B sometimes we say "A is tracking origin/B."</p>
<h2><a href="#user">user</a></h2>
<p>Users are people with personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository.</p>
<h2><a href="#user-to-server-request">user-to-server request</a></h2>
<p>An API request used by an application that performs a task on behalf of a particular user. Where a task is carried out with user-to-server authentication it's shown on GitHub as having been done by a user via an application. For example, you might choose to create an issue from within a third-party application, and the application would do this on your behalf on GitHub. The scope of tasks an application can perform using a user-to-server request is restricted by both the app's and the user's permissions and access. The token used in a user-to-server request is acquired via OAuth.
