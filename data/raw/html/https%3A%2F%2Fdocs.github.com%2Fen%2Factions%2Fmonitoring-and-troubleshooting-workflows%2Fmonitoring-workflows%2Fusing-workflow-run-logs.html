<p>You can see whether a workflow run is in progress or complete from the workflow run page. You must be logged in to a GitHub account to view workflow run information, including for public repositories. For more information, see <a href="/en/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github">Access permissions on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If the run is complete, you can see whether the result was a success, failure, canceled, or neutral. If the run failed, you can view and search the build logs to diagnose the failure and re-run the workflow. You can also view billable job execution minutes, or download logs and build artifacts.</p>
<p>GitHub Actions use the Checks API to output statuses, results, and logs for a workflow. GitHub creates a new check suite for each workflow run. The check suite contains a check run for each job in the workflow, and each job includes steps. GitHub Actions are run as a step in a workflow. For more information about the Checks API, see <a href="/en/rest/checks">REST API endpoints for checks</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
Ensure that you only commit valid workflow files to your repository. If <code>.github/workflows</code> contains an invalid workflow file, GitHub Actions generates a failed workflow run for every new commit.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#viewing-logs-to-diagnose-failures">Viewing logs to diagnose failures</a></h2>
<p>If your workflow run fails, you can see which step caused the failure and review the failed step's build logs to troubleshoot. You can see the time it took for each step to run. You can also copy a permalink to a specific line in the log file to share with your team. Read access to the repository is required to perform these steps.</p>
<p>In addition to the steps configured in the workflow file, GitHub adds two additional steps to each job to set up and complete the job's execution. These steps are logged in the workflow run with the names "Set up job" and "Complete job".</p>
<p>For jobs run on GitHub-hosted runners, "Set up job" records details of the runner image, and includes a link to the list of preinstalled tools that were present on the runner machine.</p>

<p>After deleting logs, the <strong>Delete all logs</strong> button is removed to indicate that no log files remain in the workflow run.</p>
<h3><a href="#deleting-logs-programmatically">Deleting logs programmatically</a></h3>
<p>You can use the following script to automatically delete all logs for a workflow. This can be a useful way to clean up logs for multiple workflow runs.</p>
<p>To run the example script below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy the code example and save it to a file called <code>delete-logs.sh</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grant it the execute permission with <code>chmod +x delete-logs.sh</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following command, where <code>REPOSITORY_NAME</code> is the name of your repository and <code>WORKFLOW_NAME</code> is the file name of your workflow.</p>
<div>
<header><span>Shell</span><pre>./delete-logs.sh REPOSITORY_NAME WORKFLOW_NAME
</pre></header><pre><code>./delete-logs.sh REPOSITORY_NAME WORKFLOW_NAME
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>For example, to delete all of the logs in the <code>monalisa/octocat</code> repository for the <code>.github/workflows/ci.yaml</code> workflow, you would run <code>./delete-logs.sh monalisa/octocat ci.yaml</code>.</p>

To learn more about GitHub CLI, see <a href="/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli">About GitHub CLI</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>To view the log for a specific job, use the <code>run view</code> subcommand. Replace <code>run-id</code> with the ID of run that you want to view logs for. GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a job from the run. If you don't specify <code>run-id</code>, GitHub CLI returns an interactive menu for you to choose a recent run, and then returns another interactive menu for you to choose a job from the run.</p>
<pre><code>gh run view RUN_ID --log
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>--job</code> flag to specify a job ID. Replace <code>job-id</code> with the ID of the job that you want to view logs for.</p>
<pre><code>gh run view --job JOB_ID --log
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code>grep</code> to search the log. For example, this command will return all log entries that contain the word <code>error</code>.</p>
<pre><code>gh run view --job JOB_ID --log | grep error
</code></pre>
<p>To filter the logs for any failed steps, use <code>--log-failed</code> instead of <code>--log</code>.</p>
<pre><code>gh run view --job JOB_ID --log-failed
</code></pre>
