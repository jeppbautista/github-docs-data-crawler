Support for larger runners for code scanning default setup is currently in public preview and subject to change.</p>

<h2><a href="#about-larger-runners-for-default-setup">About larger runners for default setup</a></h2>
<p>Customers on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud plans can choose from a range of managed virtual machines that have more resources than the <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources">standard GitHub-hosted runners</a>. These machines are referred to as "larger runner." They offer the following advanced features:</p>
<ul>
<li>More RAM, CPU, and disk space</li>
<li>Static IP addresses</li>
<li>Azure private networking</li>
<li>The ability to group runners</li>
<li>Autoscaling to support concurrent workflows</li>
<li>GPU-powered runners</li>
</ul>
<p>These larger runners are hosted by GitHub and have the runner application and other tools preinstalled. For more information about larger runners, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners/about-larger-runners">About larger runners</a>.</p>
<p>Consider configuring larger runners for default setup if:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your scans with standard GitHub-hosted runners are taking too long.</li>
<li>Your scans with standard GitHub-hosted runners are returning memory or disk errors.</li>
<li>You want to customize aspects of your code scanning runner like the runner size, runner image, and job concurrency without using self-hosted runners.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>
Currently, Swift analysis is not available on larger runners for default setup. Additionally, if your repository has access to a runner with the <code>code-scanning</code> label, such as a larger runner provisioned for default setup, default setup workflows will <em>only</em> use runners labeled <code>code-scanning</code>. If you would like to configure default setup on larger runners <em>and</em> analyze Swift, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provision a self-hosted macOS runner with the <code>code-scanning</code> label in addition to your larger runner. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-repository">Adding self-hosted runners</a>.</li>
<li>Ensure any repositories containing Swift <em>do not</em> have access to runners with the label <code>code-scanning</code>. Default setup workflows for that repository will only use standard runners.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="#provisioning-organization-level-larger-runners-for-default-setup">Provisioning organization-level larger runners for default setup</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Add a larger runner to your organization. See <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners/managing-larger-runners#adding-a-larger-runner-to-an-organization">Managing larger runners</a>.
<ul>
<li>To add a custom label to your larger runner, give the runner a name that matches that label. You can use this custom label when you configure default setup with larger runners. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning#assigning-labels-to-runners">Configuring default setup for code scanning</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, all repositories in your organization have access to organization-level runners, meaning every repository can use your larger runner. For information on granting only select repositories access to a larger runner, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners/managing-larger-runners#allowing-repositories-to-access-larger-runners">Managing larger runners</a>.</li>
<li>You can now configure default setup for your organization and repositories, and your larger runner will automatically pick up code scanning jobs. For more information on configuring default setup, see <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning">Configuring default setup for code scanning</a> and <a href="/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning-at-scale">Configuring default setup for code scanning at scale</a>.</li>
