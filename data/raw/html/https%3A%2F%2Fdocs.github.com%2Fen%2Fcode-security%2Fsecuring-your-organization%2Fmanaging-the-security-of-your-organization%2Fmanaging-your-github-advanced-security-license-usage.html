<h2><a href="#requirements-for-enabling-advanced-security-products">Requirements for enabling Advanced Security products</a></h2>
<p>To use GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security on private or internal repositories with unique active committers, you must have licenses available. The user-interface and options depend on how you pay for Advanced Security.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Metered billing:</strong> by default, there is no limit on how many licenses you can consume. See <a href="/en/billing/managing-your-billing/preventing-overspending">Preventing overspending</a>
.</li>
<li>
<strong>Volume/subscription billing</strong> (GitHub Enterprise only)<strong>:</strong>  once the licenses you have purchased are all in use, you cannot enable GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security on additional repositories until you free up or buy additional licenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>With security configurations, you can easily understand the license usage of repositories in your organization, as well as the number of available GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security licenses in your organization. Additionally, if you need to make more licenses available to secure a high-impact repository, you can quickly disable GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security on private and internal repositories at scale.</p>
<p>To learn about licensing for GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, and GitHub Advanced Security, see <a href="/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-advanced-security/about-billing-for-github-advanced-security">About billing for GitHub Advanced Security</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#turning-off-secret-protection-or-code-security">Turning off Secret Protection or Code Security</a></h2>
<p>The simplest way to turn off all Secret Protection or Code Security features for one or more repositories is to create a security configuration where the product is disabled at the top level. You can apply this custom configuration to repositories where you want to turn off paid features.</p>
<div>
<p>
Ensure that you give your custom configuration a very clear name, for example: "No Code Security" or "Secret Protection and Supply chain only" to avoid confusion.</p>
