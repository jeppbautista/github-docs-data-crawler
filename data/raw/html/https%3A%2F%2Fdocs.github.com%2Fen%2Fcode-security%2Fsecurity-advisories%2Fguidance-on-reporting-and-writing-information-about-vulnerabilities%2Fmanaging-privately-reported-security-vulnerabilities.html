<p>Owners and administrators of public repositories can enable private vulnerability reporting on their repositories. For more information, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository">Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#about-privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability">About privately reporting a security vulnerability</a></h2>
<p>Private vulnerability reporting makes it easy for security researchers to report vulnerabilities directly to you using a simple form.</p>
<p>When a security researcher reports a vulnerability privately, you are notified and can choose to either accept it, ask more questions, or reject it. If you accept the report, you're ready to collaborate on a fix for the vulnerability in private with the security researcher.</p>
<h2><a href="#managing-security-vulnerabilities-that-are-privately-reported">Managing security vulnerabilities that are privately reported</a></h2>
<p>When a new vulnerability is privately reported on a repository where private vulnerability reporting is enabled, GitHub notifies repository maintainers and security managers if:</p>
<ul>
<li>They're watching the repository for all activity.</li>
<li>They have notifications enabled for the repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about configuring notification preferences, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository#configuring-notifications-for-private-vulnerability-reporting">Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the repository name, click <strong>Security</strong>.

</li>
<li>
<p>In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the advisory you want to review. An advisory that was reported privately has a status of <code>Triage</code>.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully review the report, then choose how to proceed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To collaborate on a patch in private, click <strong>Start a temporary private fork</strong> to create a place for further discussions with the contributor. This does not change the status of the proposed advisory from <code>Triage</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To accept the reported vulnerability, click <strong>Accept and open as draft</strong> to accept the vulnerability report as a draft advisory on GitHub. If you choose this option:</p>
<ul>
<li>This doesn't make the report public.</li>
<li>The report becomes a draft repository security advisory and you can work on it in the same way as any draft advisory that you create.
For more information on security advisories, see <a href="/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories">About repository security advisories</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ask for more information, or to open a discussion with the reporter, you can comment on the advisory. Any comments are visible only to the reporter and to any collaborators on the advisory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have enough information to determine that the problem the reporter describes is not a security risk, click <strong>Close security advisory</strong>. Where possible, you should add a comment explaining why you don't consider the report a security risk before you close the advisory.</p>
