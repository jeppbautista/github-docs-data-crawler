<h2><a href="#accessing-the-audit-log">Accessing the audit log</a></h2>
<div>
<p>
Webhooks might be a good alternative to the audit log or API polling for certain use cases. Webhooks are a way for GitHub to notify your server when specific events occur for a repository, organization, or enterprise. Compared to the API or searching the audit log, webhooks can be more efficient if you just want to learn and possibly log when certain events occur on your enterprise, organization, or repository. See <a href="/en/webhooks">Webhooks documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The audit log lists events triggered by activities that affect your organization within the last 180 days. Only owners can access an organization's audit log.</p>
<p>By default, only events from the past three months are displayed. To view older events, you must specify a date range with the <code>created</code> parameter. See <a href="/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates">Understanding the search syntax</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the upper-right corner of GitHub, select your profile photo, then click </li>
<li>Next to the organization, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the "Archive" section of the sidebar, click <strong>Audit log</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#searching-the-audit-log">Searching the audit log</a></h2>
<p>The name for each audit log entry is composed of a category of events, followed by an operation type. For example, the <code>repo.create</code> entry refers to the <code>create</code> operation on the <code>repo</code> category.</p>
<p>Each audit log entry shows applicable information about an event, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The organization an action was performed in</li>
<li>The user (actor) who performed the action</li>
<li>The user affected by the action</li>
<li>Which repository an action was performed in</li>
<li>The action that was performed</li>
<li>Which country the action took place in</li>
<li>The date and time the action occurred</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you cannot search for entries using text. You can, however, construct search queries using a variety of filters. Many operators used when querying the log, such as <code>-</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;</code>, match the same format as searching across GitHub. For more information, see <a href="/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github">About searching on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#search-based-on-operation">Search based on operation</a></h3>
<p>Use the <code>operation</code> qualifier to limit actions to specific types of operations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>operation:access</code> finds all events where a resource was accessed.</li>
<li>
<code>operation:authentication</code> finds all events where an authentication event was performed.</li>
<li>
<code>operation:create</code> finds all events where a resource was created.</li>
<li>
<code>operation:modify</code> finds all events where an existing resource was modified.</li>
<li>
<code>operation:remove</code> finds all events where an existing resource was removed.</li>
<li>
<code>operation:restore</code> finds all events where an existing resource was restored.</li>
<li>
<code>operation:transfer</code> finds all events where an existing resource was transferred.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#search-based-on-repository">Search based on repository</a></h3>
<p>Use the <code>repo</code> qualifier to limit actions to a specific repository. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>repo:my-org/our-repo</code> finds all events that occurred for the <code>our-repo</code> repository in the <code>my-org</code> organization.</li>
<li>
<code>repo:my-org/our-repo repo:my-org/another-repo</code> finds all events that occurred for both the <code>our-repo</code> and <code>another-repo</code> repositories in the <code>my-org</code> organization.</li>
<li>
<code>-repo:my-org/not-this-repo</code> excludes all events that occurred for the <code>not-this-repo</code> repository in the <code>my-org</code> organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you must include the account name within the <code>repo</code> qualifier; searching for just <code>repo:our-repo</code> will not work.</p>
<h3><a href="#search-based-on-the-user">Search based on the user</a></h3>
<p>The <code>actor</code> qualifier can scope events based on who performed the action. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>actor:octocat</code> finds all events performed by <code>octocat</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>actor:octocat actor:hubot</code> finds all events performed by <code>octocat</code> or <code>hubot</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>-actor:hubot</code> excludes all events performed by <code>hubot</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can only use a GitHub username, not an individual's real name.</p>
<h3><a href="#search-based-on-the-action-performed">Search based on the action performed</a></h3>
<p>To search for specific events, use the <code>action</code> qualifier in your query. Actions listed in the audit log are grouped in different categories. For the full list of events in each category, see <a href="/en/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/audit-log-events-for-your-organization">Audit log events for your organization</a>.</p>

<p>You can search for specific sets of actions using these terms. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>action:team</code> finds all events grouped within the team category.</li>
<li>
<code>-action:hook</code> excludes all events in the webhook category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each category has a set of associated actions that you can filter on. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>action:team.create</code> finds all events where a team was created.</li>
<li>
<code>-action:hook.events_changed</code> excludes all events where the events on a webhook have been altered.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#search-based-on-time-of-action">Search based on time of action</a></h3>
<p>Use the <code>created</code> qualifier to filter events in the audit log based on when they occurred. Date formatting must follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO8601</a> standard, which is <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> (year-month-day). You can also add optional time information <code>THH:MM:SS+00:00</code> after the date, to search by the hour, minute, and second. That's <code>T</code>, followed by <code>HH:MM:SS</code> (hour-minutes-seconds), and a UTC offset (<code>+00:00</code>).</p>
<p>When you search for a date, you can use greater than, less than, and range qualifiers to further filter results. For more information, see <a href="/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax">Understanding the search syntax</a>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>created:2014-07-08</code> finds all events that occurred on July 8th, 2014.</li>
<li>
<code>created:&gt;=2014-07-08</code> finds all events that occurred on or after July 8th, 2014.</li>
<li>
<code>created:&lt;=2014-07-08</code> finds all events that occurred on or before July 8th, 2014.</li>
<li>
<code>created:2014-07-01..2014-07-31</code> finds all events that occurred in the month of July 2014.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>
The audit log contains data for the last 180 days.</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#search-based-on-location">Search based on location</a></h3>
<p>Using the qualifier <code>country</code>, you can filter events in the audit log based on the originating country. You can use a country's two-letter short code or its full name. Keep in mind that countries with spaces in their name will need to be wrapped in quotation marks. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>country:de</code> finds all events that occurred in Germany.</li>
<li>
<code>country:Mexico</code> finds all events that occurred in Mexico.</li>
<li>
<code>country:"United States"</code> all finds events that occurred in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#exporting-the-audit-log">Exporting the audit log</a></h2>
<p>You can export the log as JSON data or a comma-separated value (CSV) file with the <strong>Export</strong> dropdown menu.</p>
<p>To filter the results in your export, search by one or more of these supported qualifiers before using the <strong>Export</strong> dropdown menu.</p>
