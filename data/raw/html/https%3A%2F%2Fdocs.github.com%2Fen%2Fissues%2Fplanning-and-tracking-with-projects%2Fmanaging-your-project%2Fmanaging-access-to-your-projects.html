<h2><a href="#about-project-access">About project access</a></h2>
<p>Admins of organization-level projects can manage access for the entire organization, for teams, for individual organization members, and for outside collaborators.</p>
<p>Admins of user-level projects can invite individual collaborators and manage their access.</p>
<p>Project admins can also control the visibility of their project for everyone on the internet. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-visibility-of-your-projects">Managing visibility of your projects</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#managing-access-for-organization-level-projects">Managing access for organization-level projects</a></h2>
<p>You can control access to your project by setting permissions for particular individuals and teams or you can set a base permission that applies to everyone in your organization.</p>
<h3><a href="#managing-access-for-everyone-in-your-organization">Managing access for everyone in your organization</a></h3>
<p>You can manage access for everyone in your organization to a particular project by changing the project's base permission. Changes to the base permission only affect organization members who are not organization owners and who are not granted individual access.</p>
<p>You can also configure the default base permission at the organization-level for new projects and projects that haven't yet had a base permission configured. For more information about setting your organization's base permission for projects, see <a href="/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-base-permissions-for-projects">Managing base permissions for projects</a>.</p>

<p>You can also add teams, external collaborators, and individual organization members as collaborators for an organization-level project. For more information, see <a href="/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams">About teams</a>.</p>
<p>If you grant a team read permissions or greater for a project, the project is also displayed on the team's projects page. You can also add projects to a team on the team's projects page. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/adding-your-project-to-a-team">Adding your project to a team</a>.</p>

This only affects collaborators for your project, not for repositories in your project. To view an item on the project, someone must have the required permissions for the repository that the item belongs to. Only people with access to a private repository will be able to view project items from that private repository.
