Once you delete an artifact, it cannot be restored.</p>
</div>
<p>Write access to the repository is required to perform these steps.</p>
<p>By default, GitHub stores build logs and artifacts for 90 days, and this retention period can be customized. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy">Usage limits, billing, and administration</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="#setting-the-retention-period-for-an-artifact">Setting the retention period for an artifact</a></h2>
<p>Retention periods for artifacts and logs can be configured at the repository, organization, and enterprise level. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#artifact-and-log-retention-policy">Usage limits, billing, and administration</a>.</p>
<p>You can also define a custom retention period for individual artifacts using the <code>actions/upload-artifact</code> action in a workflow. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts#configuring-a-custom-artifact-retention-period">Storing and sharing data from a workflow</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#finding-the-expiration-date-of-an-artifact">Finding the expiration date of an artifact</a></h2>
<p>You can use the API to confirm the date that an artifact is scheduled to be deleted. For more information, see the <code>expires_at</code> value returned by the REST API. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/actions/artifacts">REST API endpoints for GitHub Actions artifacts</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#artifacts-from-deleted-workflow-runs">Artifacts from deleted workflow runs</a></h2>
<p>When a workflow run is deleted all artifacts associated with the run are also deleted from storage. You can delete a workflow run using the GitHub Actions UI, the REST API, or using the GitHub CLI, see: <a href="/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/deleting-a-workflow-run">Deleting a workflow run</a>, <a href="/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#delete-a-workflow-run">Delete a workflow run</a>, or <a href="https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_run_delete">gh run delete</a>.</p>
