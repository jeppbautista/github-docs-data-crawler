<h2><a href="#syntax-for-filtering-a-list-of-projects">Syntax for filtering a list of projects</a></h2>
<p>You can combine filters and even search project titles by including text. For example, <code>is:open creator:octocat game</code> will return open projects, created by the @octocat user, with the word "game" in the project title. You can use the search qualifiers in the following table to narrow down your search for a project.</p>

































<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Qualifier</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>is:open</code></td>
<td>Returns projects that are currently open.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>is:closed</code></td>
<td>Returns projects that are currently closed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>is:template</code></td>
<td>Returns projects that are marked as a template.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>is:private</code></td>
<td>Returns projects are set to private visibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>is:public</code></td>
<td>Returns projects are set to public visibility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>creator:USERNAME</code></td>
<td>Returns projects created by USERNAME. For example, <code>creator:octocat</code> will return projects created by @octocat.</td>
