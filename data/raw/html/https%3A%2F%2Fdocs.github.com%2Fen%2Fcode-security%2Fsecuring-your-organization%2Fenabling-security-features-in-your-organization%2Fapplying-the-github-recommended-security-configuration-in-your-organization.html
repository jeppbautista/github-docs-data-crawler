<h2><a href="#about-the-github-recommended-security-configuration">About the GitHub-recommended security configuration</a></h2>
<p>The GitHub-recommended security configuration is a collection of enablement settings for GitHub's security features that is created and maintained by subject matter experts at GitHub. The GitHub-recommended security configuration is designed to successfully reduce the security risks for low- and high-impact repositories. We recommend you apply this configuration to all the repositories in your organization.</p>
<div>
<p>
The GitHub-recommended security configuration includes GitHub Code Security and GitHub Secret Protection features. Applying the configuration to repositories in your organization will incur usage costs or require licenses.</p>

<li>
<p>In the "Security" section of the sidebar, select the <strong>Configurations</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the "GitHub recommended" row of the configurations table for your organization, select the <strong>Apply to</strong> <strong>All repositories</strong> or <strong>All repositories without configurations</strong>.</p>
<div>
<p>
The default security configuration for an organization is only automatically applied to new repositories created in your organization. If a repository is transferred into your organization, you will still need to apply an appropriate security configuration to the repository manually.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the detailed information about how your changes will affect GitHub Secret Protection, GitHub Code Security, or GitHub Advanced Security license consumption. To apply the security configuration, click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The security configuration is applied to both active and archived repositories because some security features run on archived repositories, for example, secret scanning. In addition, if a repository is later unarchived you can be confident that it is protected by the chosen security configuration.</p>

If a user in your organization attempts to change the enablement status of a feature in an enforced configuration using the REST API, the API call will appear to succeed, but no enablement statuses will change.</p>
<p>Some situations can break the enforcement of security configurations for a repository. For example, the enablement of code scanning will not apply to a repository if:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Actions is initially enabled on the repository, but is then disabled in the repository.</li>
<li>GitHub Actions required by code scanning configurations are not available in the repository.</li>
<li>The definition for which languages should not be analyzed using code scanning default setup is changed.</li>
</ul>

<p>After you apply the GitHub-recommended security configuration, you can customize your organization-level security settings with global settings. See <a href="/en/code-security/securing-your-organization/enabling-security-features-in-your-organization/configuring-global-security-settings-for-your-organization">Configuring global security settings for your organization</a>.</p>
<p>You may encounter an error when you attempt to apply a security configuration.
