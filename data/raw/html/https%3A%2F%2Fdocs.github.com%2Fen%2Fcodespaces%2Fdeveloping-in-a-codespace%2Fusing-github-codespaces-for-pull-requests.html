<p>Using a codespace to work on a pull request gives you all the benefits of GitHub Codespaces. For more information, see <a href="/en/codespaces/about-codespaces/codespaces-features">GitHub Codespaces features</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#about-pull-requests-in-github-codespaces">About pull requests in GitHub Codespaces</a></h2>
<p>GitHub Codespaces provides you with many of the capabilities you might need to work with pull requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-source-control-in-your-codespace#raising-a-pull-request">Create a pull request</a> - Using either the Terminal and Git commands or the "Source Control" view, you can create pull requests just as you would on GitHub. If the repository uses a pull request template, you'll be able to use this within the "Source Control" view.</li>
<li>
<a href="#opening-a-pull-request-in-codespaces">Open a pull request</a> â€“ You can open an existing pull request in a codespace, provided you have codespace access to the branch that is being merged in.</li>
<li>
<a href="#reviewing-a-pull-request-in-codespaces">Review a pull request</a> - Once you have opened a pull request in a codespace, you can use the "GitHub Pull Request" view to add review comments and approve pull requests. You can also use GitHub Codespaces to <a href="#view-comments-from-a-review-in-codespaces">view review comments</a>.</li>
</ul>
