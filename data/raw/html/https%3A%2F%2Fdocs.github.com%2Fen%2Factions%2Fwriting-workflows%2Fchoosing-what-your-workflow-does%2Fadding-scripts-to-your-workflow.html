<p>You can use a GitHub Actions workflow to run scripts and shell commands, which are then executed on the assigned runner. This example demonstrates how to use the <code>run</code> keyword to execute the command <code>npm install -g bats</code> on the runner.</p>
<pre><code><span>jobs:</span>
  <span>example-job:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>steps:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>run:</span> <span>npm</span> <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> <span>bats</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To use a workflow to run a script stored in your repository you must first check out the repository to the runner. Having done this, you can use the <code>run</code> keyword to run the script on the runner. The following example runs two scripts, each in a separate job step. The location of the scripts on the runner is specified by setting a default working directory for run commands. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-jobs/setting-default-values-for-jobs">Setting a default shell and working directory</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>jobs:</span>
  <span>example-job:</span>
    <span>runs-on:</span> <span>ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span>defaults:</span>
      <span>run:</span>
        <span>working-directory:</span> <span>./scripts</span>
    <span>steps:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>name:</span> <span>Check</span> <span>out</span> <span>the</span> <span>repository</span> <span>to</span> <span>the</span> <span>runner</span>
        <span>uses:</span> <span>actions/checkout@v4</span>  
      <span>-</span> <span>name:</span> <span>Run</span> <span>a</span> <span>script</span>
        <span>run:</span> <span>./my-script.sh</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>name:</span> <span>Run</span> <span>another</span> <span>script</span>
        <span>run:</span> <span>./my-other-script.sh</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Any scripts that you want a workflow job to run must be executable. You can do this either within the workflow by passing the script as an argument to the interpreter that will run the script - for example, <code>run: bash script.sh</code> - or by making the file itself executable. You can give the file the execute permission by using the command <code>git update-index --chmod=+x PATH/TO/YOUR/script.sh</code> locally, then committing and pushing the file to the repository. Alternatively, for workflows that are run on Linux and Mac runners, you can add a command to give the file the execute permission in the workflow job, prior to running the script:</p>
