<p>This guide will walk you through setting up, configuring and managing your GitHub Enterprise Cloud account as an enterprise owner.</p>
<p>GitHub provides two types of Enterprise products:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub Enterprise Cloud</strong></li>
<li><strong>GitHub Enterprise Server</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the products is that GitHub Enterprise Cloud is hosted by GitHub, while GitHub Enterprise Server is self-hosted.</p>
<p>GitHub Enterprise Cloud includes an enterprise account, which allows you to manage multiple organizations. You can choose to let enterprise members create and manage their own personal accounts, or you can use Enterprise Managed Users. For more information about GitHub Enterprise Cloud, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-cloud">About GitHub Enterprise Cloud</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#part-1-setting-up-your-enterprise-account">Part 1: Setting up your enterprise account</a></h2>
<p>To get started with GitHub Enterprise Cloud, decide which type of enterprise to create, create an enterprise account, and add one or more organizations.</p>
<h3><a href="#1-choosing-an-enterprise-type">1. Choosing an enterprise type</a></h3>
<p>To control access to your enterprise's resources, you can allow people to use a personal account on GitHub.com and optionally configure additional SAML access restrictions, or you can provision and control the accounts for your enterprise using your identity provider (IdP) with Enterprise Managed Users. Before you begin using GitHub Enterprise Cloud, you must decide which type of enterprise to use. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/choosing-an-enterprise-type-for-github-enterprise-cloud">Choosing an enterprise type for GitHub Enterprise Cloud</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#2-about-enterprise-accounts">2. About enterprise accounts</a></h3>
<p>An enterprise account allows you to centrally manage policy and settings for multiple GitHub organizations, including member access, billing and usage and security. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-your-enterprise-account/about-enterprise-accounts">About enterprise accounts</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#3-creating-an-enterprise-account">3. Creating an enterprise account</a></h3>
<p>To create your enterprise account, start a free 30-day trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/setting-up-a-trial-of-github-enterprise-cloud">Setting up a trial of GitHub Enterprise Cloud</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="#4-adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise-account">4. Adding organizations to your enterprise account</a></h3>
<p>You can add any number of new or existing organizations to manage within your enterprise account. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/adding-organizations-to-your-enterprise">Adding organizations to your enterprise</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#5-creating-a-readme-for-the-enterprise">5. Creating a README for the enterprise</a></h3>
<p>To help people understand what is happening in your enterprise, you should create a README. For example, you can use a README to help members learn about different organizations in the enterprise, to share links to important resources, or to communicate information about the settings and policies of your enterprise. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-your-enterprise-account/creating-a-readme-for-an-enterprise">Creating a README for an enterprise</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#6-viewing-the-subscription-and-usage-for-your-enterprise-account">6. Viewing the subscription and usage for your enterprise account</a></h3>
<p>You can view your current subscription, license usage, invoices, payment history, and other billing information for your enterprise account at any time. Both enterprise owners and billing managers can access and manage billing settings for enterprise accounts. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/viewing-the-subscription-and-usage-for-your-enterprise-account">Viewing the subscription and usage for your enterprise account</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#part-2-managing-your-enterprise-members-with-github-enterprise-cloud">Part 2: Managing your enterprise members with GitHub Enterprise Cloud</a></h2>
<p>If your enterprise uses Enterprise Managed Users, your members are fully managed through your identity provider. Adding members, making changes to their membership, and assigning roles is all managed using your IdP. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users">About Enterprise Managed Users</a>.</p>
<p>If your enterprise does not use Enterprise Managed Users, follow the steps below.</p>
<h3><a href="#1-assigning-roles-in-an-enterprise">1. Assigning roles in an enterprise</a></h3>
<p>By default, everyone in an enterprise is a member of the enterprise. There are also administrative roles, including enterprise owner and billing manager, that have different levels of access to enterprise settings and data. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise">Roles in an enterprise</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#2-inviting-people-to-manage-your-enterprise">2. Inviting people to manage your enterprise</a></h3>
<p>You can invite people to manage your enterprise as enterprise owners or billing managers or remove administrators who no longer need access. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/inviting-people-to-manage-your-enterprise">Inviting people to manage your enterprise</a>.</p>
<p>You can also grant enterprise members the ability to manage support tickets in the support portal. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/managing-support-entitlements-for-your-enterprise">Managing support entitlements for your enterprise</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#3-viewing-people-in-your-enterprise">3. Viewing people in your enterprise</a></h3>
<p>To audit access to enterprise-owned resources or user license usage, you can view every enterprise administrator, enterprise member, and outside collaborator in your enterprise. You can see the organizations that a member belongs to and the specific repositories that an outside collaborator has access to. For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/viewing-people-in-your-enterprise">Viewing people in your enterprise</a>.</p>
