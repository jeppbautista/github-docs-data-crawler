<h2><a href="#overview-of-github-hosted-runners">Overview of GitHub-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>Runners are the machines that execute jobs in a GitHub Actions workflow. For example, a runner can clone your repository locally, install testing software, and then run commands that evaluate your code.</p>
<p>GitHub provides runners that you can use to run your jobs, or you can <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">host your own runners</a>. Each GitHub-hosted runner is a new virtual machine (VM) hosted by GitHub with the runner application and other tools preinstalled, and is available with Ubuntu Linux, Windows, or macOS operating systems. When you use a GitHub-hosted runner, machine maintenance and upgrades are taken care of for you.</p>
<p>You can choose one of the standard GitHub-hosted runner options or, if you are on the GitHub Team or GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan, you can provision a runner with more cores, or a runner that's powered by a GPU processor. These machines are referred to as "larger runner." For more information, see <a href="/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners/about-larger-runners">About larger runners</a>.</p>
<p>Using GitHub-hosted runners requires network access with at least 70 kilobits per second upload and download speeds.</p>
<h2><a href="#using-a-github-hosted-runner">Using a GitHub-hosted runner</a></h2>
<p>To use a GitHub-hosted runner, create a job and use <code>runs-on</code> to specify the type of runner that will process the job, such as <code>ubuntu-latest</code>, <code>windows-latest</code>, or <code>macos-latest</code>. For the full list of runner types, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources">About GitHub-hosted runners</a>. If you have <code>repo: write</code> access to a repository, you can view a list of the runners available to use in workflows in the repository. For more information, see <a href="#viewing-available-runners-for-a-repository">Viewing available runners for a repository</a>.</p>
<p>When the job begins, GitHub automatically provisions a new VM for that job. All steps in the job execute on the VM, allowing the steps in that job to share information using the runner's filesystem. You can run workflows directly on the VM or in a Docker container. When the job has finished, the VM is automatically decommissioned.</p>
<p>The following diagram demonstrates how two jobs in a workflow are executed on two different GitHub-hosted runners.</p>
<p><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-72692/images/help/actions/overview-github-hosted-runner.png" alt="Diagram of a workflow that consists of two jobs. One job runs on Ubuntu and the other runs on Windows." width="599" height="436"></source></picture></p>
<p>The following example workflow has two jobs, named <code>Run-npm-on-Ubuntu</code> and <code>Run-PSScriptAnalyzer-on-Windows</code>. When this workflow is triggered, GitHub provisions a new virtual machine for each job.</p>
<ul>
<li>The job named <code>Run-npm-on-Ubuntu</code> is executed on a Linux VM, because the job's <code>runs-on:</code> specifies <code>ubuntu-latest</code>.</li>
<li>The job named <code>Run-PSScriptAnalyzer-on-Windows</code> is executed on a Windows VM, because the job's <code>runs-on:</code> specifies <code>windows-latest</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="#limitations-for-arm64-macos-runners">Limitations for arm64 macOS runners</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>All actions provided by GitHub are compatible with arm64 GitHub-hosted runners. However, community actions may not be compatible with arm64 and need to be manually installed at runtime.</li>
<li>Nested-virtualization and Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) are not supported due to the limitation of Apple's Virtualization Framework.</li>
<li>Networking capabilities such as Azure private networking and assigning static IPs are not currently available for macOS larger runners.</li>
<li>The arm64 macOS runners do not have a static UUID/UDID assigned to them because Apple does not support this feature. However, Intel MacOS runners are assigned a static UDID, specifically <code>4203018E-580F-C1B5-9525-B745CECA79EB</code>. If you are building and signing on the same host you plan to test the build on, you can sign with a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-profiles/create-a-development-provisioning-profile/">development provisioning profile</a>. If you do require a static UDID, you can use Intel runners and add their UDID to your Apple Developer account.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#larger-runners">Larger runners</a></h3>
<p>Customers on GitHub Team and GitHub Enterprise Cloud plans can choose from a range of managed virtual machines that have more resources than the <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources">standard GitHub-hosted runners</a>. These machines are referred to as "larger runner." They offer the following advanced features:</p>
<ul>
<li>More RAM, CPU, and disk space</li>
<li>Static IP addresses</li>
<li>Azure private networking</li>
<li>The ability to group runners</li>
<li>Autoscaling to support concurrent workflows</li>
<li>GPU-powered runners</li>
</ul>
<p>These larger runners are hosted by GitHub and have the runner application and other tools preinstalled.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners">Using larger runners</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#runner-images">Runner Images</a></h2>
<p>GitHub maintains our own set of VM images for our standard hosted runners. This includes the images for macOS, x64 linux and Windows images. The list of images and their included tools are managed in the <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images"><code>actions/runner-images</code></a> repository. Our arm64 images are partner images, and those are managed in the <a href="https://github.com/actions/partner-runner-images"><code>actions/partner-runner-images</code></a> repository.</p>
<h3><a href="#preinstalled-software-for-github-owned-images">Preinstalled software for GitHub-owned images</a></h3>
<p>The software tools included in our GitHub-owned images are updated weekly. The update process takes several days, and the list of preinstalled software on the <code>main</code> branch is updated after the whole deployment ends.</p>
<p>Workflow logs include a link to the preinstalled tools on the exact runner. To find this information in the workflow log, expand the <code>Set up job</code> section. Under that section, expand the <code>Runner Image</code> section. The link following <code>Included Software</code> will describe the preinstalled tools on the runner that ran the workflow.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/viewing-workflow-run-history">Viewing workflow run history</a>.</p>
<p>GitHub-hosted runners include the operating system's default built-in tools, in addition to the packages listed in the above references. For example, Ubuntu and macOS runners include <code>grep</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>which</code>, among other default tools.</p>
<p>You can also view a software bill of materials (SBOM) for each build of the Windows and Ubuntu runner images. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#reviewing-the-supply-chain-for-github-hosted-runners">Security hardening for GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#using-preinstalled-software">Using preinstalled software</a></h3>
<p>We recommend using actions to interact with the software installed on runners. This approach has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, actions provide more flexible functionality like version selection, ability to pass arguments, and parameters</li>
<li>It ensures the tool versions used in your workflow will remain the same regardless of software updates</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a tool that you'd like to request, please open an issue at <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images">actions/runner-images</a>. This repository also contains announcements about all major software updates on runners.</p>
<h3><a href="#installing-additional-software">Installing additional software</a></h3>
<p>You can install additional software on GitHub-hosted runners. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/customizing-github-hosted-runners">Customizing GitHub-hosted runners</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#cloud-hosts-used-by-github-hosted-runners">Cloud hosts used by GitHub-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>GitHub hosts Linux and Windows runners on virtual machines in Microsoft Azure with the GitHub Actions runner application installed. The GitHub-hosted runner application is a fork of the Azure Pipelines Agent. Inbound ICMP packets are blocked for all Azure virtual machines, so ping or traceroute commands might not work. GitHub hosts macOS runners in Azure data centers.</p>
<h2><a href="#workflow-continuity">Workflow continuity</a></h2>
<p>If GitHub Actions services are temporarily unavailable, then a workflow run is discarded if it has not been queued within 30 minutes of being triggered. For example, if a workflow is triggered and the GitHub Actions services are unavailable for 31 minutes or longer, then the workflow run will not be processed.</p>
<p>In addition, if the workflow run has been successfully queued, but has not been processed by a GitHub-hosted runner within 45 minutes, then the queued workflow run is discarded.</p>
<h2><a href="#administrative-privileges">Administrative privileges</a></h2>
<p>The Linux and macOS virtual machines both run using passwordless <code>sudo</code>. When you need to execute commands or install tools that require more privileges than the current user, you can use <code>sudo</code> without needing to provide a password. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.27/sudo.man.html">Sudo Manual</a>.</p>
<p>Windows virtual machines are configured to run as administrators with User Account Control (UAC) disabled. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works">How User Account Control works</a> in the Windows documentation.</p>
<h2><a href="#ip-addresses">IP addresses</a></h2>
<p>To get a list of IP address ranges that GitHub Actions uses for GitHub-hosted runners, you can use the GitHub REST API. For more information, see the <code>actions</code> key in the response of the <code>GET /meta</code> endpoint. For more information, see <a href="/en/rest/meta/meta#get-github-meta-information">REST API endpoints for meta data</a>.</p>
<p>Windows and Ubuntu runners are hosted in Azure and subsequently have the same IP address ranges as the Azure datacenters. macOS runners are hosted in GitHub's own macOS cloud.</p>
<p>Since there are so many IP address ranges for GitHub-hosted runners, we do not recommend that you use these as allowlists for your internal resources. Instead, we recommend you use larger runners with a static IP address range, or self-hosted runners. For more information, see <a href="/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners">Using larger runners</a> or <a href="/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">About self-hosted runners</a>.</p>
<p>The list of GitHub Actions IP addresses returned by the API is updated once a week.</p>
<h2><a href="#communication-requirements-for-github-hosted-runners">Communication requirements for GitHub-hosted runners</a></h2>
<p>A GitHub-hosted runner must establish connections to GitHub-owned endpoints to perform essential communication operations. In addition, your runner may require access to additional networks that you specify or utilize within an action.</p>
<p>To ensure proper communications for GitHub-hosted runners between networks within your configuration, ensure that the following communications are allowed.</p>
<div>
<p>
Some of the domains listed are configured using <code>CNAME</code> records. Some firewalls might require you to add rules recursively for all <code>CNAME</code> records. Note that the <code>CNAME</code> records might change in the future, and that only the domains listed will remain constant.</p>

<h2><a href="#the-etchosts-file">The <code>etc/hosts</code> file</a></h2>
<p>GitHub-hosted runners are provisioned with an <code>etc/hosts</code> file that blocks network access to various cryptocurrency mining pools and malicious sites. Hosts such as MiningMadness.com and cpu-pool.com are rerouted to localhost so that they do not present a significant security risk.</p>
<h2><a href="#file-systems">File systems</a></h2>
<p>GitHub executes actions and shell commands in specific directories on the virtual machine. The file paths on virtual machines are not static. Use the environment variables GitHub provides to construct file paths for the <code>home</code>, <code>workspace</code>, and <code>workflow</code> directories.</p>

























<table>
<thead><tr>
<th>Directory</th>
<th>Environment variable</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>home</code></td>
<td><code>HOME</code></td>
<td>Contains user-related data. For example, this directory could contain credentials from a login attempt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>workspace</code></td>
<td><code>GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code></td>
<td>Actions and shell commands execute in this directory. An action can modify the contents of this directory, which subsequent actions can access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>workflow/<wbr>event.json</wbr></code></td>
<td><code>GITHUB_EVENT_PATH</code></td>
<td>The <code>POST</code> payload of the webhook event that triggered the workflow. GitHub rewrites this each time an action executes to isolate file content between actions.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>For a list of the environment variables GitHub creates for each workflow, see <a href="/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables">Store information in variables</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#docker-container-filesystem">Docker container filesystem</a></h3>
<p>Actions that run in Docker containers have static directories under the <code>/github</code> path. However, we strongly recommend using the default environment variables to construct file paths in Docker containers.</p>
<p>GitHub reserves the <code>/github</code> path prefix and creates three directories for actions.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/github/home</code></li>
<li>
<code>/github/workspace</code> - <strong>Note:</strong> GitHub Actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Ensure your Dockerfile does not set the <code>USER</code> instruction, otherwise you will not be able to access <code>GITHUB_WORKSPACE</code>.</li>
<li><code>/github/workflow</code></li>
</ul>
