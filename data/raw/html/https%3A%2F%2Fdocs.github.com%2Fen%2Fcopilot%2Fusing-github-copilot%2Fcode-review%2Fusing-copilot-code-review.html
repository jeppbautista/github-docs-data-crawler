<h2><a href="#about-copilot-code-review">About Copilot code review</a></h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot can review your code and provide feedback. Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.</p>
<div>
<p>Copilot code review in Visual Studio Code supports two types of review:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Review selection:</strong> Highlight code and ask for an initial review</li>
<li>
<strong>Review changes:</strong> Request a deeper review of all your changes</li>
</ul>
<p>The current functionality and availability of the two types of review is summarized in the following table:</p>

<h3><a href="#code-review-monthly-quota">Code review monthly quota</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>review changes</strong> type of Copilot code review is a premium feature with a per-person monthly quota.</p>
<div>
<p>
The per-person quota for Copilot code review will commence on June 4, 2025.</p>
</div>
<p>When you assign Copilot as a reviewer for a pull request, one premium request is deducted from your monthly quota each time Copilot posts comments to the pull request. See <a href="/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests">About premium requests</a>.</p>
<p>If a repository is configured to automatically request a code review from Copilot for all new pull requests, the premium request usage is applied to the quota of the pull request author. If a pull request is created by GitHub Actions or by a bot, the usage will apply to the user who triggered the workflow (if identifiable), or to a designated billing owner.</p>
<p>When you reach your monthly quota you will not be able to get a code review from Copilot until your quota resets—unless you upgrade your Copilot plan or enable additional premium requests.</p>
</div>

<p> Copilot isn't guaranteed to spot all problems or issues in a pull request, and sometimes it will make mistakes. Always validate Copilot's feedback carefully, and supplement Copilot's feedback with a human review.</p>

<div>
<p>These instructions explain how to use Copilot code review in the GitHub website. To see instructions for other popular coding environments, use the tool switcher at the top of the page.</p>
<h3><a href="#requesting-a-pull-request-review-from-copilot">Requesting a pull request review from Copilot</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On GitHub.com, create a pull request or navigate to an existing pull request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the <strong>Reviewers</strong> menu, then select <strong>Copilot</strong>.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-33497/images/help/copilot/code-review/request-review@2x.png" alt="Screenshot of selecting 'Copilot' from the 'Reviewers' menu." width="360" height="330"></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for Copilot to review your pull request. This usually takes less than 30 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scroll down and read through Copilot's comments.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-132888/images/help/copilot/code-review/review-comment@2x.png" alt="Screenshot of a code review left by Copilot." width="720" height="544"></source></picture></div>
<p>Copilot always leaves a "Comment" review, not an "Approve" review or a "Request changes" review. This means that Copilot's reviews do not count toward required approvals for the pull request, and Copilot's reviews will not block merging changes. For more details, see <a href="/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/approving-a-pull-request-with-required-reviews">Approving a pull request with required reviews</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copilot's review comments behave like review comments from humans. You can add reactions to them, comment on them, resolve them and hide them.</p>
<p>Any comments you add to Copilot's review comments will be visible to humans, but they won't be visible to Copilot, and Copilot won't reply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#working-with-suggested-changes-provided-by-copilot">Working with suggested changes provided by Copilot</a></h2>
<p>Where possible, Copilot's feedback includes suggested changes which you can apply with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>If you're happy with the changes, you can accept a single suggestion from Copilot and commit it, or accept a group of suggestions together in a single commit. For more information, see <a href="/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request">Incorporating feedback in your pull request</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to validate Copilot's suggested changes (for example by running automated tests or your linter), or if you want to make modifications before committing the suggested changes, click the <strong>Open in Workspace</strong> button. For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-for-pull-requests/using-copilot-to-help-you-work-on-a-pull-request">Using Copilot to help you work on a pull request</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#providing-feedback-on-copilots-reviews">Providing feedback on Copilot's reviews</a></h2>
<p>You can provide feedback on Copilot's comments directly within each comment. We use this information to improve the product and the quality of Copilot's suggestions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On a pull request review comment from Copilot, click the thumbs up (👍) or thumbs down (👎) button.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-19709/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-controls@2x.png" alt="Screenshot showing a Copilot code review comment with the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons." width="720" height="184"></source></picture></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you click the thumbs down button, you're asked to provide additional information. You can, optionally, pick the reason for your negative feedback and leave a comment before clicking <strong>Submit feedback</strong>.</p>
<div><picture><source><img src="/assets/cb-90167/images/help/copilot/code-review/feedback-modal@2x.png" alt="Screenshot of the form for providing additional information when you give negative feedback on a comment from Copilot." width="565" height="621"></source></picture></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#requesting-a-re-review-from-copilot">Requesting a re-review from Copilot</a></h2>
<p>When you push changes to a pull request that Copilot has reviewed, it won't automatically re-review your changes.</p>
<p>To request a re-review from Copilot, click the <strong>Reviewers</strong> menu. For more information, see <a href="/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review">Requesting a pull request review</a>.</p>
<div>
<p> When re-reviewing a pull request, Copilot may repeat the same comments again, even if they have been dismissed with the "Resolve conversation" button or downvoted with the thumbs down (👎) button.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#enabling-automatic-reviews">Enabling automatic reviews</a></h2>
<p>By default, you manually request a review from Copilot on each pull request, in the same way you would request a review from a human. However, you can set up Copilot to automatically review all pull requests. See <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-automatic-code-review-by-copilot">Configuring automatic code review by Copilot</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#customizing-copilots-reviews-with-coding-guidelines">Customizing Copilot's reviews with coding guidelines</a></h2>
<div>
<p> The custom coding guidelines feature is only available with the Copilot Enterprise plan, and is currently limited to selected customers.</p>
</div>
<p>When using Copilot code review to review changes in Visual Studio Code or the GitHub website, you can customize Copilot's review with custom coding guidelines written in natural language. Copilot will give feedback based on your coding guidelines when it reviews your code. For more information, see <a href="/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/configuring-coding-guidelines">Configuring coding guidelines for GitHub Copilot code review</a>.</p>
<p>Comments generated based on a coding guideline will include a message, highlighting their source.</p>
