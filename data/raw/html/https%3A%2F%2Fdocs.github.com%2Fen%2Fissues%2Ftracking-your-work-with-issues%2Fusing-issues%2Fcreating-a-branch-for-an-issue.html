The ability to create a branch for an issue is currently in public preview and subject to change.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#about-branches-connected-to-an-issue">About branches connected to an issue</a></h2>
<p>Branches connected to an issue are shown under the "Development" section in the sidebar of an issue. When you create a pull request for one of these branches, it is automatically linked to the issue. The connection with that branch is removed and only the pull request is shown in the "Development" section. For more information, see <a href="/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue">Linking a pull request to an issue</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#creating-a-branch-for-an-issue">Creating a branch for an issue</a></h2>
<p>Anyone with write permission to a repository can create a branch for an issue. You can link multiple branches for an issue.</p>
<p>By default, the new branch is created in the current repository, and from the default branch.</p>
